## Strategic Assessment

### Batch Quality Analysis
The M17 climate tech batch had a very low success rate (12.5%), indicating challenges in this domain:

1. **Handle Quality**: Many handles were either inactive/abandoned accounts or very low-following personal accounts
2. **Domain Maturity**: Climate tech influencers may be less concentrated on Twitter/X compared to other domains
3. **Discovery Method**: The seed list may need better curation for this domain

### Success Story
- **Mark Ruffalo**: Exceptional addition with 7.8M+ followers and strong climate advocacy credentials
- Represents celebrity-activist crossover influence in climate space
- High-quality profile with verified status and substantial reach

### Recommendations
1. **Better Seed Curation**: Focus on established climate tech VCs, founders, and policy makers
2. **Cross-Platform Discovery**: Consider LinkedIn or other platforms for climate tech voices
3. **Domain Expert Input**: Consult climate tech insiders for better influencer identification
