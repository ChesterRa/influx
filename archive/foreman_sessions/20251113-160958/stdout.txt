Wrote a concise Foreman directive to both peers with alignment and smallest next steps.

- File: .cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md:1
- Highlights:
  - Pivot locked; T000001/T000002 done; T000003 closed infeasible; latest=151 valid.
  - PeerA: draft propose-subtask for M1 manual scale; then update POR Now/Next after ACK.
  - PeerB: add daily snapshot GitHub Action; then add m04 business seeds to grow 151→≥180.
  - Inbox hygiene: process oldest-first and note GitHub scope closure.

Want me to also scaffold the snapshot workflow YAML?
