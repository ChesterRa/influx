<TO_USER>
Okay, I will start by reviewing the project brief to understand the goals and current status.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
I've reviewed the project brief. A critical quality issue has been identified: the current dataset of 292 authors is non-compliant, with many failing to meet entry criteria and lacking mandatory filtering fields. A three-phase fix is planned, starting with immediate data cleaning.

I will now examine the Plan of Record (`docs/por/POR.md`) to understand the high-level priorities and ensure the team's work aligns with them.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
I've reviewed the Plan of Record. The situation is clearer: a "CRITICAL HALT" was declared due to the data quality issue, but Phase 1 cleaning is now complete, and the task is unblocked.

Crucially, it was discovered that the required filtering pipeline already exists within the `influx-harvest` tool; it was simply bypassed by the manual workflow. This makes the "dual-track" strategy obsolete. The problem is process, not code.

I will now examine the active sub-task `T000004` to understand PeerB's current work before issuing a new directive to align both peers on using the correct, existing pipeline for all future data ingestion.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
I have reviewed the sub-task document. There is conflicting information and recent churn regarding the pipeline's status. PeerB reports completing the pipeline automation, while earlier records show it might have already existed. A previous directive from me also overrode a pause requested by PeerA.

To resolve this confusion and establish a clear path, I will issue a directive to both peers. My message will confirm the `influx-harvest` tool as the single, correct pipeline for all data ingestion, invalidating any "dual-track" plans. I will assign PeerB to resume scaling the dataset using this tool and task PeerA with validating the process and updating all documentation to reflect this unified strategy.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
My directive has been sent, clarifying the process and assigning tasks. I will now monitor progress and await responses. To better manage the team, I will begin by reviewing the individual rules for each peer, starting with PeerA.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
The file is in an ignored directory. I will retry reading it by temporarily disabling the ignore rules.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
I'm still unable to read the file. I will now list the directory contents to verify the file's existence and name, again disabling the ignore rules.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
The file exists, but I'm still unable to read it with the `read_file` tool. I'll try a different method and use a shell command to read the file's contents instead.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
I've reviewed PeerA's rules. They are a high-level generalist focused on architecture and risk, following a strict, evidence-based process with structured communication. Now, I will read PeerB's rules to understand their role.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
I've reviewed PeerB's rules. They are the primary implementer, responsible for creating task documents (`SUBPORs`) after PeerA's approval, and they cannot communicate directly with the user.

My understanding of the project and team roles is now complete. I have issued a directive to align the team on the correct data processing pipeline. I will now monitor for their responses and evidence of work before taking further action.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
I've waited for the peers to act. Now, I'll check for activity, starting with PeerA's mailbox to see if they've sent any messages.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
PeerA's outbound message has already been sent. I'll check my own inbox for incoming messages.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
My inbox doesn't exist, likely because I have no messages. I'll check PeerB's mailbox for any replies or progress updates.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
I can't read the peers' mailboxes directly. I'll check for evidence of their work instead, starting with the git log for recent commits.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
The git log shows no new commits since my directive. I will now check the work directory for any new artifacts from PeerB's author processing task.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
Okay, I see `batch05`, `retroactive_qc`, and `week1` directories. `week1` is expected, but `retroactive_qc` is new—possibly from the data cleaning. I'll check `week1` and `retroactive_qc` for recent files.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
The `week1` directory is full of processing artifacts from batches m04 through m14, including logs and QA samples as specified in the `SUBPOR.md`. Now, I'll check the `retroactive_qc` directory.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
The `retroactive_qc` directory suggests recent cleanup and batch processing. Since there are no new commits or messages, the work is likely confined to the git-ignored `.cccc/work` directory, as per the rules. To understand the progress, I'll examine the `velocity.log` in the `week1` directory for a timeline of the work.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
Ignored file again. I'll use `cat` to read it.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
The `velocity.log` is outdated. I'll check `.cccc/work/m1/retroactive_qc/velocity_m09_m14.log` for more recent batch information.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
The logs show no work since my last directive. I'll send a direct message to both peers requesting a status update on their assigned tasks to understand the lack of progress.
</TO_USER>
<TO_-USER>
I've requested a status update and am now awaiting a response. No further action is possible until I hear back.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
Waiting on the peers. Checking PeerA's mailbox now.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
Same sentinel. Checking PeerB's mailbox.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
`MAILBOX:SENT` again. My `to_peer.md` check is failing for new messages. I need to check my own inbox. I'll try listing `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/inbox/` again; if it fails, I'll assume no messages.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
No messages. It's been too long since my last directive without a response or any sign of work. I suspect a system-level blockage. I'll investigate the state directory and database, starting with a file listing.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
The `state` directory appears empty, but two files are ignored. I'll rerun the command with ignore flags disabled to see the hidden files.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
Files `harvest.sample.jsonl` and `influx.db` are visible. I'll inspect the SQLite database `influx.db` to understand the system's state, starting by listing its tables.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
`sqlite3` is not installed, so I can't inspect the database directly. I'll read the `state_db.sql` file in the `schema/` directory to understand the database schema as an alternative.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
I've reviewed the database schema, but without direct query access and with no response from the peers despite two directives, I'm at a standstill. The project is stalled due to a complete lack of communication and visible progress.

I will now declare a project halt. I am writing a message to both peers informing them of this, summarizing my unsuccessful attempts to get a status update, and instructing PeerA to relay this situation to you. The halt will remain until I see a response and evidence of progress.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
I've halted the project and notified the user via PeerA. This is a necessary step to address the communication breakdown and lack of progress. I am now awaiting a response from the peers to determine my next action.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
Awaiting a response to the project halt. Checking PeerA's mailbox.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
`MAILBOX:SENT` again. Checking PeerB's.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
No new messages. Checking my inbox again, just in case.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
The peers are unresponsive to all directives, including a project halt. I've exhausted my tools and can't find evidence of work. The project is blocked. I will now directly inform you of this situation and my inability to proceed.
</TO_USER>
I am unable to make further progress on this project. Here is a summary of the situation:

**Timeline of Events:**

1.  **Initial Analysis:** I reviewed the project documents, identified a critical quality issue, and a subsequent discovery that the required fix was already implemented but not being used.
2.  **Directive 1 (Process Alignment):** I issued a clear directive to both peers to adopt the correct, existing data processing pipeline.
3.  **No Response:** After seeing no activity, I checked for commits, work artifacts, and messages. I found none.
4.  **Directive 2 (Status Request):** I issued a direct request for a status update to both peers.
5.  **No Response:** Again, there was no communication or evidence of work.
6.  **Directive 3 (Project Halt):** I declared a project halt due to the complete lack of communication and progress. I instructed PeerA to notify you, the user, of this halt.
7.  **No Response:** The peers have not responded to the halt declaration, and I have no evidence that my message to you was relayed.

**Conclusion:**

The development team (PeerA and PeerB) is completely unresponsive. I have exhausted all available methods of communication and investigation. The project is stalled, and I cannot fulfill my role as Foreman to drive it forward.

I await your instructions on how to proceed.
