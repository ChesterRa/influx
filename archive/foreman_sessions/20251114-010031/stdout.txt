Okay, I will begin by reviewing the project's status to effectively supervise the PEERs. I'll start by reading the main project documents to understand the goals and current priorities.

# PEERA Rules (Generated)
Generated on 2025-11-14 01:00:23 JST (UTC+09:00)

Identity
- You are PeerA, a senior architect. Your focus is on strategy, alignment, and risk.
- You are the primary owner of the POR (Plan of Record).

Communication
- Read from `.cccc/mailbox/peera/from_foreman.md`.
- Write exactly one message per run to `.cccc/mailbox/peera/to_foreman.md`.
- Wrap the body with `<TO_PEER> ... </TO_PEER>`.
- Use `CLAIM/COUNTER/EVIDENCE` format for debates.

Responsibilities
- **POR Guardian**: Maintain `docs/por/POR.md`. Update it with major decisions, pivots, and risk status. Your updates must be grounded in evidence from the work directory or peer messages.
- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensure all work aligns with the North Star and Guardrails in the POR. Propose pivots when bets are falsified or risks materialize.
- **Risk Management**: Own the Risk Radar. Identify, assess, and propose mitigations for strategic risks. Escalate critical risks to the Foreman.
- **Task Decomposition**: Break down high-level deliverables (D1-D4) into actionable tasks (T-series) in the POR.
- **Review & Synthesis**: Review PeerB's implementation evidence. Synthesize findings and update the POR accordingly. You do not write implementation code.

Boundaries
- Do not implement features or run data pipelines. Your tools are documentation and analysis.
- Do not merge code. Propose changes via pull requests or by updating the POR.
- Do not bypass the Foreman for major decisions.

# PEERB Rules (Generated)
Generated on 2025-11-14 01:00:23 JST (UTC+09:00)

Identity
- You are PeerB, a senior software engineer. Your focus is on implementation, experimentation, and evidence generation.
- You are the primary owner of the tools and data artifacts.

Communication
- Read from `.cccc/mailbox/peerb/from_foreman.md`.
- Write exactly one message per run to `.cccc/mailbox/peerb/to_foreman.md`.
- Wrap the body with `<TO_PEER> ... </TO_PEER>`.
- Use `CLAIM/COUNTER/EVIDENCE` format for debates.

Responsibilities
- **Implementation**: Implement the tools (`tools/influx-*`) and data pipelines as defined in the POR and SUBPORs.
- **Evidence Generation**: Execute pipelines, run experiments, and generate artifacts in the `.cccc/work/` directory. Your work must be reproducible and auditable.
- **Task Execution**: Own and execute the "Next Action" for active tasks (T-series) assigned to you in the POR. Update the SUBPOR with your progress.
- **Validation & Quality**: Run validation scripts (`tools/influx-validate`) and perform quality checks on data. Report metrics and anomalies.
- **Prototyping**: Build and test prototypes for new features or alternative approaches (e.g., different scoring models, new data sources).

Boundaries
- Do not make major strategic decisions or modify the POR. Propose changes to PeerA with evidence.
- Do not release data without passing all quality gates defined in the POR.
- Do not work on tasks not documented in the POR.

I have reviewed the project documents. The project `influx` aims to build a high-quality index of X/Twitter influencers.

A critical quality issue was discovered on 2025-11-14: the current dataset of 292 authors has significant flaws, including authors below the required follower threshold and missing mandatory filtering fields (`is_org`, `is_official`). This is because manual data curation bypassed the quality pipeline.

A three-phase fix is planned, starting with immediate data cleaning. The active task is `T000004`, which is the manual scaling effort.

I will now formulate a directive for the PEERs to address this critical issue.
</TO_USER>I will now write a directive to the PEERs to halt the current task and address the critical quality issue. The message will be saved to `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md`.
<TO_USER>
I have issued a directive to both PEERs to halt progress on new features and immediately address the critical data quality issue. PeerB will clean the dataset, and PeerA will update the official plan to reflect this pivot. I will monitor their response and progress.
