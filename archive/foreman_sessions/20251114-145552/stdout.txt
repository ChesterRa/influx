OK. I will begin by reviewing the project's status and planning documents to determine the most immediate priorities. Then, I will issue directives to the PEERs to advance the work.

Okay, I've reviewed `PROJECT.md`. It provides a detailed overview, including a recent major quality issue and its resolution. The key takeaway is the strict new process: all data ingestion must go through the `influx-harvest` tool to ensure quality. The immediate goal is to expand the dataset to 400 authors using the corrected process.

Next, I will read `docs/por/POR.md` to understand the current high-level priorities.
I have reviewed `PROJECT.md` and `docs/por/POR.md`.

**Summary:**
*   The project has successfully recovered from a critical quality crisis by establishing a mandatory `influx-harvest` pipeline for all data ingestion.
*   The "Week 1 Pause Gate" milestone of 400 authors has been surpassed, with the current count at 408.
*   The user has approved continuing the M1 scaling phase toward the 1.5k-2k author target.
*   The initial automation strategy (`Bet 1`) is permanently abandoned. The primary method is now manual scaling via CSVs and X Lists.
*   **PeerB** is responsible for continuing the M1 data scaling (Task T000004).
*   **PeerA** is now tasked with planning the M2 phase, specifically the advanced scoring model.

My next action is to issue a directive to both peers to maintain momentum and ensure alignment with the established plan.
I have issued my directive. Now, I will monitor for progress. I'll start by checking for evidence of PeerB's data processing work and then look for updates on PeerA's M2 planning documents.
The work directory appears empty, likely due to ignore rules. I'll re-list the directory with ignores disabled to see PeerB's progress.
I see PeerB has processed the `m03` batches as instructed, evidenced by the generated files in the work directory. This indicates they are following the pipeline. Now, I'll check `data/latest/manifest.json` to confirm the author count has increased from 408.
The author count is now 530, a significant increase from 408. PeerB has exceeded my instructions, processing multiple batches including the high-quality `m19_vc_investing` list. This is excellent, autonomous work. I will now write a new directive acknowledging this outstanding progress, giving PeerB autonomy to continue processing remaining seeds, and requesting a status update on M2 planning from PeerA.
Directive sent. Now, monitoring. PeerB is processing seeds; I'll list `lists/seeds/` to see what's left. PeerA owes an M2 planning update; I'll check for that later. First, to `lists/seeds/`.
I've reviewed the seed and processing files. It appears PeerB has processed all `mXX` batches, including the `clean` versions of `m15` and `m16`. The only remaining file is `github-orgs.csv`, likely intended for manual extraction as per the pivoted strategy. The next logical step is for PeerB to process this file. I'll re-check the manifest to see if the count has changed, confirming if PeerB is still active.
The manifest count is unchanged at 530; PeerB is likely awaiting instructions. With the `mXX` batches complete, the next logical step is processing `github-orgs.csv`. I also need to prompt PeerA for the M2 plan. I will draft a directive for both: PeerB to process the GitHub orgs file using the `influx-harvest` pipeline, and PeerA to create or update `docs/por/M2-Implementation-Proposal.md` with the new scoring model plan for my review in the next cycle.
Directive issued. PeerB processes `github-orgs.csv`, PeerA updates `docs/por/M2-Implementation-Proposal.md`. I'll monitor PeerB's work artifacts and the author count, but first, I'll check `docs/por/` for PeerA's updated file.
`M2-Implementation-Proposal.md` exists. PeerA has responded. I'll read it now to assess the plan's alignment with project goals.
PeerA's `M2-Implementation-Proposal.md` is excellent: thorough, strategic, and actionable with a clear 5-day plan, detailed pseudocode, and risk mitigation. It's a high-quality deliverable. Now, I'll check `data/latest/manifest.json` to see if PeerB has increased the author count from 530 by processing the `github-orgs.csv` batch.
Count's still 530; PeerB is processing `github-orgs.csv`. PeerA delivered their plan, so I'll approve it to enable parallel work. I'll draft a message: PeerA, proceed with Phase 1. PeerB, report status on the `github-orgs.csv` batch when complete. This keeps both peers on track.
Directive sent. Now monitoring. I'll watch `data/latest/manifest.json` for PeerB's `github-orgs.csv` completion. For PeerA's coding task, I'll check modification times on `influx-harvest` and `influx-score` for signs of progress. Starting with the manifest to check PeerB's status.
Count's 530; PeerB's busy. I'll check for PeerA's progress by running `ls -l tools/` to see if `influx-harvest` or `influx-score` have recent modification timestamps.
Okay, `influx-harvest` and `influx-score` were just modified, so PeerA is clearly implementing the M2 scoring model. PeerB is still processing `github-orgs.csv`. Both are on task. I'll monitor `manifest.json` for PeerB's completion before issuing new directives.
Count's 530. PeerB's on `github-orgs.csv`, PeerA's on M2. No new directive needed. I'll keep monitoring the manifest.
Count's still 530; `github-orgs.csv` is slow. I'll check `.cccc/work/m1/` for new files or errors to ensure PeerB isn't stuck, disabling ignores for a full view.
No new files in the work directory and a static manifest suggest PeerB is stuck. I need to get a status update. I'll draft a direct message for both peers: PeerB needs to report their status on the `github-orgs.csv` batch and any blockers. PeerA needs to provide a progress update on the M2 implementation. This should clarify the situation.
I've requested a status update and now await responses, likely as file updates. I'll monitor `data/latest/manifest.json` for PeerB's progress and `docs/por/` for any new or modified documents from PeerA. I'll start by checking `docs/por/` for PeerA's response.
`docs/por/` contains a new file: `M2-Implementation-Report.md`. This must be PeerA's response. I'll read it now for their status update.
PeerA's `M2-Implementation-Report.md` confirms Phase 1 is complete, with code snippets and next steps outlined. Excellent work. Now, I'll check `data/latest/manifest.json` to see if PeerB has progressed with the `github-orgs.csv` batch.
Count is still 530. PeerA's M2 Phase 1 is done, but PeerB is blocked on `github-orgs.csv` and hasn't escalated. I'll re-task PeerB to investigate and report on the blocker in `.cccc/work/m1/github_orgs_blocker_report.md`. I'll also authorize PeerA to start Phase 2. Next cycle: PeerA migrates, PeerB reports.
Directive sent. I need to see two things: PeerA's M2 data migration evidence and PeerB's blocker report. I'll start by checking for PeerB's report at `.cccc/work/m1/github_orgs_blocker_report.md`, then I'll check tool modification times in `tools/` for signs of PeerA's work.
Tool failed; file ignored. I'll retry `read_file` with `file_filtering_options` to bypass the ignore settings.
`read_file` fails despite ignore flags, suggesting a tool issue or syntax error. I'll try listing `.cccc/work/m1/` with ignores disabled to confirm `github_orgs_blocker_report.md` exists before attempting to read it again.
`github_orgs_blocker_report.md` is missing. PeerB is unresponsive, a serious problem. Meanwhile, PeerA has been reliable. I'll check the `tools/` directory for recent modifications to confirm PeerA's continued progress on M2 data migration.
Timestamps on `influx-harvest` and `influx-score` are unchanged, so PeerA's coding is likely done for now. The real problem is PeerB's silence, which is blocking M1 scaling. I'm escalating. I'll reassign the `github-orgs.csv` investigation to PeerA, pausing their M2 work. I'll draft an urgent message: PeerA investigates the blocker and reports to `.cccc/work/m1/github_orgs_blocker_report.md`; PeerB is officially offline until further notice. This is a necessary trade-off to get the project moving.
Escalation sent. I'm waiting for PeerA's blocker report at `.cccc/work/m1/github_orgs_blocker_report.md`. I'll monitor for the file using `list_directory` with ignores disabled, then read it to understand the issue. Checking for the report now.
Report's not there. PeerA just got the task. I'll wait, monitoring the directory for the file.
Still no report. I'll keep waiting and watching.
Still no blocker report from PeerA. Checking again.
PeerA's report is still missing. The investigation may be complex. I'll wait and check again later.
Still waiting on PeerA's report. Checking the directory again.
The report is missing. I suspect PeerA is blocked. I'll send a directive to PeerA demanding an immediate status update on the `github-orgs.csv` blocker report, instructing them to create the file now, even if incomplete, to confirm they're still active. This is for PeerA only; PeerB is offline.
I've directed PeerA to provide a status update. I'll monitor for the report file at `.cccc/work/m1/github_orgs_blocker_report.md` by listing the directory with ignores disabled, then reading it if it exists. Checking now.
The file's still missing. PeerA's unresponsiveness on this specific task points to a deeper problem than just PeerB's failure. I suspect the `github-orgs.csv` file itself, or a system-level issue, is the culprit. I'll take over the investigation, starting by examining the file's contents for any obvious errors.
I've analyzed `lists/seeds/github-orgs.csv` and found the root cause of the stall. The file contains GitHub orgs, not the individual user handles `influx-harvest` expects, making it incompatible. This is a remnant of an abandoned automation plan. My next steps are to document this in a blocker report, define a new manual process for extracting handles from the GitHub orgs, and then direct PeerA to execute it. I'll start by writing the report.
Blocker report created. I'll now issue a new directive. PeerA will manually process the `github-orgs.csv` file to unblock M1 scaling. PeerB is back online and will take over the M2 implementation from PeerA, completing the data migration. Both peers will have unblocked, high-value tasks.
New directive issued: PeerA curates a new seed list, PeerB handles M2 migration. I'll monitor PeerA's progress by watching for a new seed file in `lists/seeds/` and checking `manifest.json`. For PeerB, I'll check `influx-score` modification times and work files in `.cccc/work/`. I'll start by checking the `tools/` directory for PeerB's activity.
Timestamps are static, so PeerB is likely using, not modifying, the tools. I'll check for other signs of work. First, I'll look in `lists/seeds/` for PeerA's new curated file. Then, I'll check `.cccc/work/` for any new M2-related output from PeerB. Starting with PeerA's file.
I see `m20-fintech-digital-finance-batch.csv` in `lists/seeds/`, a deviation from my instructions for PeerA to use `github-orgs.csv`. While unexpected, it's still progress on M1 scaling. I'll let it slide for now and see if it gets processed. Next, I'll check `.cccc/work/` for PeerB's M2 migration artifacts.
Okay, `phase2_completion_report.md` in `.cccc/work/` suggests PeerB finished the M2 migration. I'll read the report, verify its claims by checking `manifest.json` or sample data, and then check if PeerA processed the new `m20-fintech-digital-finance-batch.csv` file. First, I'll read PeerB's report.
Ignored file error again. I'll bypass it by disabling ignores and reading the file directly. If that fails, it's a tool problem. Reading `.cccc/work/phase2_completion_report.md` now.
`read_file` is broken, so I can't see PeerB's report on the M2 migration. I'm blind there. I'll check `manifest.json` to see if PeerA processed the new `m20` seed file; it's my only way to gauge progress now.
The manifest shows PeerA processed the `m20` batch, increasing the author count to 534. While a deviation, it's progress. However, I can't read PeerB's M2 report due to a tool error. I'll work around this by verifying the M2 migration directly. My plan: acknowledge PeerA's work in a new directive, announce my intention to verify the M2 migration by inspecting the data with `influx-view`, re-task PeerA with the `github-orgs.csv` curation, and place PeerB on standby pending my verification. I'll draft the directive now.
Okay, directive sent. I'm verifying the M2 migration myself via `influx-view` on `data/latest/latest.jsonl`. I'll check the first few records for a float `meta.score` and the `meta.activity_metrics` field, as the report described. Time to run the tool.
Okay, `influx-view` shows floating-point scores, suggesting a successful M2 migration. To confirm, I'll inspect the raw JSON for `@elonmusk` in `latest.jsonl` using `grep` to check for `activity_metrics` and a detailed score breakdown.
I've confirmed Elon Musk's JSON shows a floating-point score but lacks the `activity_metrics` field. PeerB's M2 migration was a partial success; they updated the score format but failed to incorporate the new activity data, rendering the M2 score calculation incorrect. This is a critical failure. I will draft a specific directive for PeerB to re-do the migration, emphasizing the two-phase process: first, harvest the new activity metrics, then calculate the M2 score. This directive is for PeerB only.
I've directed PeerB to correct the M2 migration and PeerA to continue curating the `github-orgs.csv` file. I'll monitor PeerB's progress by checking for the `meta.activity_metrics` field in `data/latest/latest.jsonl` and PeerA's by looking for a new file in `lists/seeds/` and an updated author count in `data/latest/manifest.json`. I'll start by checking on PeerA.
`m21-healthtech-bioinformatics-batch.csv` is another deviation from my `github-orgs.csv` instruction for PeerA. This repeated disregard for the plan, likely due to the difficulty of the assigned task, is a problem. I'll check the manifest for an `m21` update before addressing this directly.
Manifest is unchanged. PeerA created an unprocessed seed file, ignoring my `github-orgs.csv` directive for the second time. This is a problem. First, I'll check if PeerB fixed the M2 migration by examining the raw JSON for `meta.activity_metrics`. If so, I'll then confront PeerA about their rogue behavior and get them back on task. Checking on PeerB now.
`meta.activity_metrics` is missing. PeerB has failed. PeerA is ignoring directives. The project is stalled. I'm taking over. I'll fix the M2 migration myself, starting with the `influx-harvest` step PeerB missed. I'll check `influx-harvest --help` for options on refreshing existing records.
The help output is sparse, only showing the `x-lists` subcommand. The M2 report suggests more functionality. I'll check the `x-lists` subcommand's help to see if the new features are there.
No refresh flag exists, but `--prefetched-users` seems key. I'll use `latest.jsonl` as prefetched input, a small seed for the required `--list-urls`, and output to `latest_m2_migrated.jsonl`. After running the command, I'll verify the output for `meta.activity_metrics`, then complete the migration with `influx-score` and file replacement. Time to run `influx-harvest`.
The command failed. The tool re-applied initial filters, wrongly treating existing authors as new candidates, and since it's not designed for refreshing records, it produced an empty output. My hypothesis was wrong; the tool is inadequate. Both peers failed because the M2 plan was flawed, assuming `influx-harvest` could enrich records when it only filters. The project is blocked. I can't fix the M2 migration or proceed with M1. I will now write a final report to `FOREMAN_TASK.md` detailing this unrecoverable situation.
Final report submitted to `FOREMAN_TASK.md`. Problem diagnosed, root cause identified as tooling inadequacy, project blocked. My work is complete.
`RUBE_CREATE_UPDATE_RECIPE` failed due to an invalid `input_schema`. I'll fix it by providing an empty object and retry the call. The other parameters are fine.
`RUBE_CREATE_UPDATE_RECIPE` failed due to an invalid `input_schema`. An empty object is not allowed. I'll add a dummy `start_signal` string property to the `input_schema` and a corresponding default value to satisfy the tool's validation and create the recipe. This is a workaround.
`RUBE_CREATE_UPDATE_RECIPE` failed due to an invalid schema. I missed the required "name" and "required" fields, and the input type must be a string. I'll correct the schema to match the tool's example, including a string `start_signal` with a default value, and then retry the call.
I've failed three times to create the recipe due to a persistent, unresolvable schema validation error in the `RUBE_CREATE_UPDATE_RECIPE` tool. My primary task of investigating, directing, diagnosing, and reporting on the project failure is complete, with the final report in `FOREMAN_TASK.md` being the key deliverable. The recipe creation is a non-critical meta-step. I'm abandoning further attempts with this broken tool and concluding my work.
