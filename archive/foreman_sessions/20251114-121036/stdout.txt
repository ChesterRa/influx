Okay, I will begin by reviewing the project documentation to understand the goals, current status, and next steps.

<TO_USER>
Okay, I have reviewed the project documents. Here's a summary of the current situation:

**Project Goal:** Build a high-quality index of 5k-10k influential X/Twitter authors, focusing on non-brand, non-official accounts across various domains like AI, Tech, and Security.

**Current Status:**
*   **M1 Pause Gate Reached:** The project has successfully reached its initial goal of 408 authors, surpassing the 400-author target for the M1 pause gate.
*   **Quality Crisis Resolved:** A critical issue where low-quality data bypassed filters has been identified and resolved. A single, mandatory data ingestion pipeline (`influx-harvest`) is now in place to ensure all data is properly filtered and validated.
*   **Strategic Pivot:** The initial plan for automated author discovery via GitHub was found to be infeasible. The project has successfully pivoted to a manual curation strategy, which has proven effective.
*   **M2 Planning Underway:** With the M1 pause gate achieved, planning for the next phase (M2) is in progress. This includes refining the author scoring model and exploring cost-effective ways to gather activity metrics.

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1.  **PeerA:** Focus on M2 strategic planning, specifically refining the scoring model and codifying the single-path data ingestion process in the project documentation.
2.  **PeerB:** Continue scaling the author index by processing the remaining data batches (e.g., `m03-additional-batch.csv`, `m03-final-top-tier.csv`).

I will now proceed to check the active tasks and the work of the peers to ensure they are aligned with these next steps.

<TO_PEER>
CLAIM: The project has successfully recovered from a quality crisis and achieved its M1 pause gate milestone of 400+ authors. The team has pivoted to a sustainable manual curation process and is now ready to scale towards the 1.5k-2k M1 target while simultaneously planning for M2.

EVIDENCE:
- `docs/por/POR.md`: "M1 Execution Summary" section states "ACHIEVED & SURPASSED - 408/400 authors (102% of target)".
- `docs/por/POR.md`: "Risk Radar" R6 is marked as "RESOLVED - Pipeline filter enforcement gap".
- `docs/por/POR.md`: "Decision & Pivot Log" details the pivot from automated to manual collection.
- `PROJECT.md`: "修复计划 (P0 - 阻塞 M1 继续)" section outlines the successful data cleaning and pipeline repair.
- `docs/por/POR.md`: "Maintenance & Change Log" entry for 2025-11-14 03:16 confirms the strategic direction from Foreman for PeerA (M2 planning) and PeerB (continue scaling).

NEXT STEPS:
- I will now examine the active task `T000004` and the latest work from both peers to ensure alignment with the current strategic direction.
- I will then issue directives to PeerA and PeerB to either continue their current work if it's aligned, or to adjust their focus based on the POR.

<TO_USER>
I've identified a conflict between the high-level project plan (`POR.md`) and the detailed task plan (`T000004/SUBPOR.md`).

*   The main plan directs PeerB to continue scaling the author list.
*   The task plan has an outdated instruction to halt scaling and pivot to the next phase (M2).

PeerB is correctly following the main plan and has grown the list to 467 authors. The task plan needs to be updated to reflect the current strategy.

I will now write instructions to the peers to resolve this and check for any new messages.

<TO_PEER>
To: Both
<TO_PEER>
There is a conflict between the strategic `POR.md` and the task-specific `T000004/SUBPOR.md`. The `POR.md` correctly reflects the current strategy to continue M1 scaling, while the `SUBPOR.md` contains an outdated directive to halt.

**PeerB:** You are on the right track. Continue executing the M1 scaling plan as per the `POR.md`. Process the next available, unsaturated data batches (e.g., `m12-opensource`, `m13-security`, `m14-datascience`).

**PeerA:** The `Next` step in `docs/por/T000004-m1-manual-scale/SUBPOR.md` is obsolete. Please update it to reflect the current strategy: "Continue M1 scaling by processing weekly batches, aiming for a cumulative total of 1.5k-2k authors, while maintaining all quality gates." This is a documentation and alignment task.

<TO_USER>
I have sent the instructions to the peers to resolve the conflicting plans. I will now check for any new messages from them.
</TO_USER>
<TO_USER>
There are no new messages from the peers. I have given them their instructions and will now wait for them to complete their tasks. I will check on their progress in the next cycle.
</TO_USER>
<TO_PEER>
CLAIM: I have identified a planning conflict between the strategic POR and a tactical SUBPOR and have issued corrective directives to both peers.

EVIDENCE:
- The `to_peer.md` message I sent clearly outlines the conflict and provides specific, actionable instructions for both PeerA (documentation update) and PeerB (continue execution).
- My read of `docs/por/POR.md` and `docs/por/T000004-m1-manual-scale/SUBPOR.md` confirms the discrepancy.

NEXT STEPS:
- My work for this cycle is complete. I will await the next scheduled run.
- In the next run, I will verify that PeerA has updated the `SUBPOR.md` and that PeerB has made progress on scaling the dataset, as per my instructions.
