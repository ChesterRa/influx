Okay, I will start by reviewing the project goals, current priorities, and active tasks to understand the project's status. Then, I will check the peers' roles and recent activities to provide clear guidance.

Project status understood. The quality crisis has been resolved, and the 400-author milestone is surpassed. The new "single path" strategy using `influx-harvest` is key. I will now check for unread messages and then direct the peers on their next tasks for scaling to the 1.5k-2k target.

Okay, mailboxes are clear. The project has surpassed its 400-author goal and is now scaling to 1.5k-2k.

Based on the plan, PeerA will focus on M2 strategic planning (scoring, docs), while PeerB continues data acquisition. I'll now identify the next unprocessed data batches for PeerB to work on.
Okay, I've identified the unprocessed seed files. The next batches for scaling are `m03-additional-batch.csv`, `m03-final-top-tier.csv`, and `m10-ai-education-batch.csv`.

My plan is to assign PeerB to process the `m03` batches to continue the scaling effort, while PeerA begins M2 planning by working on the scoring model refinement. I will now compose and send the directive.
<TO_USER>
Directives have been sent to both peers. PeerA will begin M2 planning, and PeerB will continue with data scaling. I will now await their progress reports.
