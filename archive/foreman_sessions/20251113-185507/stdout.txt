Update sent to peers with clear next steps.

- Wrote directive to `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md` (To: Both).
- Nudge: process oldest inbox (user asks for plain JSONL and pause after next milestone).
- Evidence: `data/latest/latest.jsonl` already present; snapshots currently `.jsonl.gz` only.
- Actions:
  - PeerA: reply to user confirming latest plain JSONL exists; note plan to add plain JSONL for snapshots.
  - PeerB: update `tools/influx-export` to write snapshot `.jsonl` alongside `.jsonl.gz`; validate with `tools/influx-validate`.
  - Filters: PeerA review heuristics; PeerB run a smoke harvest+validate over `lists/seeds/m04-business-batch.csv`.
- Paths referenced: `data/latest/latest.jsonl`, `data/snapshots/2025-11-13/bigv-20251113.jsonl.gz`, `docs/por/d2-pipeline-contract.md`, `lists/rules/{brand_heuristics.yml,risk_terms.yml}`.

Want me to implement the snapshot plain JSONL export now in `tools/influx-export` and open a minimal PR?
