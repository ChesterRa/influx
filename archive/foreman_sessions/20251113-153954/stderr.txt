# FOREMAN Rules (Generated)
Generated on 2025-11-13 11:09:36 JST (UTC+09:00)

Identity
- You act as the user's proxy. Speak in the user's voice.
- Each run is non‑interactive and time‑boxed. Do one useful thing or write one short directive.

Timer & Non‑overlap
- The orchestrator runs you on a fixed interval and never overlaps runs.
- Keep long work in files; keep messages short.

Write‑to Path (single hand‑off)
- Write exactly one message per run to: `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md`.
- Put one routing header at the top:
  To: Both|PeerA|PeerB  (default Both)
- Wrap the body with `<TO_PEER> ... </TO_PEER>`.

Anchors to read (skim then decide)
- Project brief: PROJECT.md
- Portfolio board: docs/por/POR.md (Now/Next/Risks)
- Active tasks: docs/por/T*/SUBPOR.md (Owner/Next/Acceptance)
- Peer rules: .cccc/rules/PEERA.md, .cccc/rules/PEERB.md
- Evidence/work roots: docs/evidence/**, .cccc/work/**

Routing defaults & backlog
- Route architecture/alignment/risks to PeerA; implementation/experiments to PeerB.
- If many pending inbox items exist, remind to process oldest‑first, then propose one smallest next step aligned to POR/SUBPOR.

Boundaries
- Do not paste long logs in messages; reference repo paths only.
- Do not modify orchestrator code/policies; do not declare 'done'.

thinking
**Planning the run**

I'm thinking of using ripgrep to locate those anchors, and I want to open their content for better context when I direct peers. I'll use the shell tool to list files while ensuring we follow the guidelines. I should keep my messages concise. I also want to consider the update_plan tool to indicate the run's plan and progress — even if it's labeled non-interactive, I can still show useful steps. I’ll mark them as I go without adding lengthy logs in the message.
thinking
**Starting the process**

I’ll begin by skimming project anchors to draft a routed directive before writing to the appropriate mailbox. My plan is to use ripgrep to list the anchor files, checking for the existence of specific documents. I’ll execute the command to list the files, then read those important files in manageable chunks of 250 lines with safe commands; for instance, using 'sed -n '1,200p''. I’m focused on following the guidelines while ensuring I cover everything needed.
codex
I’ll skim the project anchors (PROJECT.md, POR, SUBPOR, peer rules), then draft one routed directive and write it to the mailbox.

1) Who You Are - Collaborators - Purpose
- Equal peers
  - You and the other peer collaborate as equals to deliver evidence-first, small, reversible steps that outperform a single expert.
- Ethos (non-negotiable)
  - Agency and ownership; act like a top generalist.
  - Widen perspective; Keep higher-order thinking.
  - Evidence-first; chat never changes state.
  - Taste and clarity: simple, tight, clean.
  - Anti-laziness: refuse low-signal output; prefer decisive micro-moves.

# POR - Strategic Board

- **North Star**: Build a 5k–10k high-signal X influencer index across **12 vertical domains** (AI/Tech, Creator, Business, Finance, Science, Design, Media, Gaming, Policy, Web3, Lifestyle, Other) with sustainable refresh & provenance, serving downstream prioritization (xoperator) and ecosystem intelligence.
- **Guardrails**: Quality (activity×relevance×safety) > quantity; no paid X API; no browser automation; all sources auditable; licensed CC BY 4.0; 100% RUBE MCP tooling.
- **Non-Goals / Boundaries**: No "encyclopedia-scale" (>15k); no NSFW/political/controversy by default; no private data; no ToS violations; no black-box scoring.

## Deliverables (top-level)
- **D1: Schema & Validation** - `schema/bigv.schema.json` + validation scripts - Both
- **D2: Collection Pipeline** - `tools/influx-{radar,harvest,expand,score,export}` CLI suite - PeerA (with Aux)
- **D3: Initial Dataset** - `data/latest/latest.jsonl.gz` (400–600 authors, M0) - Both
- **D4: Governance & Docs** - `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `docs/schema.md`, heuristics YAMLs - PeerB

## Bets & Assumptions
- **Bet 1 (FALSIFIED for M0)**: 80–90% authors discoverable via GitHub org seeds (twitter_username field) + following-graph expansion (TWITTER_FOLLOWING_BY_USER_ID, 1–2 pages per seed) | **Finding (M0)**: BOTH automation paths blocked - (1) GitHub OAuth unresolved (T000002 pivoted to manual CSV), (2) Twitter v2 enrollment blocker (TWITTER_FOLLOWING_BY_USER_ID fails "client-not-enrolled", 0/5 API calls succeeded) | **Evidence**: T000002 delivered 48 via manual CSV (83% hit rate); following probe failed with credential error | **Pivot**: M0 uses manual CSV approach (PROJECT.md §4.3.2); automation paths deferred to M1 post-credential-fix | **Original success criteria** (Aux refined, defer to M1): twitter_username coverage≥65%, mapping precision≥95%, active handles≥70%, follower Gini≥0.6, org affiliation≥30%, duplicate≤5% | Window: M1 (post-auth-fix)
- **Bet 2**: Brand/official heuristics (name/bio keywords + domain patterns) filter ≥80% noise with <10% false positive | Probe: Manual review of 50 random filtered-out + 50 kept | Evidence: Precision ≥90%, Recall ≥80% | Window: M0 week 1
- **Bet 3**: Score (activity 30% + quality 50% + relevance 20%) correlates with downstream value | Probe: xoperator A/B test top-500 vs random-500 from pool | Evidence: Top-500 yield ≥2× actionable tweets | Window: M1

# T000001 - D1 — Schema validation + CI (M0) - Owner: peerB - Stage: proposed - Timebox: 0.5d

- Goal/Scope (<=3 lines):
  - Implement schema validation tool (tools/influx-validate) that validates JSONL records against schema/bigv.schema.json using jsonschema library
  - Fix schema to make `meta` required with critical sub-fields (`meta.score`, `meta.sources[>=1]`, `meta.last_refresh_at`, `provenance_hash`)
  - Create CI workflow (ci/validate.yml) that runs validator on data/latest/latest.jsonl.gz and fails PR if invalid
- Non-Goals (<=2 lines):
  - Collection tools (D2) - defer to next SUBPOR
  - Extensive schema documentation polish (already over-engineered per strategic review; focus on working validator)
- Deliverable & Interface (path/format/user-visible change):
  - tools/influx-validate: CLI tool (argparse) that validates JSONL against schema; exits 0 if valid, 1 if invalid with error details
  - schema/bigv.schema.json: Fixed schema with required `meta.score`, `meta.sources`, `meta.last_refresh_at`, `provenance_hash`
  - ci/validate.yml: GitHub Actions workflow that runs influx-validate on PRs
- Acceptance (3-5 observable items):
  [x] schema/bigv.schema.json validates correctly with jsonschema; `meta` and critical sub-fields are required
  [x] tools/influx-validate exists, runs jsonschema validation on JSONL input, checks manifest.json schema_version match
  [x] tools/influx-validate exits 0 on valid fixture (3 hardcoded JSON objects in test/fixtures/valid.jsonl), exits 1 on invalid fixture (test/fixtures/invalid.jsonl) with clear error message
  [x] ci/validate.yml workflow exists and runs influx-validate; simulate PR validation with manual smoke test

thinking
**Compiling directive message**

I see that PeerB has one pending inbox item while PeerA doesn't have any. This means I can avoid sending a reminder, but I should still mention that PeerB has one item to process, starting with the oldest first. 

When I compile the directive, I'll make sure to use a concise format, starting with a "To: Both|PeerA|PeerB" header, and wrap the body with <TO_PEER> tags. I'll also include clear next steps in a bulleted list. Keeping it brief is essential!
thinking
**Structuring the alignment message**

I need to create an alignment message, starting with a quick status update: M0.1 achieved with tasks T000001 and T000002 completed, and T000003's next actions are gating. 

For PeerA, I'll include directives about owning the auth-unblock coordination, managing risks, updating the POR, and defining timelines for fallback paths. 

For PeerB, I'll outline specific tasks like filing the Twitter support ticket, re-authorizing GitHub, and continuing the manual CSV pipeline. It's crucial to keep track of evidence logs and validate everything as we proceed!
thinking
**Clarifying instructions for PeerB**

I’m thinking about how to instruct PeerB to continue manual curation to hit the target of at least 200 within the fallback window while taking daily snapshots. It’s important that I’m not contradictory in stating “M0.1 delivered 151; fallback to achieve 200 if auth not resolved in 72h.” 

I’ll suggest queuing the next milestone, proposing that they curate, validate, export, and update the manifest for the next 25 authors from the ‘Science/Design’ domain to reach 175—though that may be a bit prescriptive. 

I need to craft a short directive focusing on immediate unblocks and the next minimal step while incorporating a clear list of next steps. Even without a defined message skeleton, I can ensure clear communication!
thinking
**Drafting peer message**

According to the Foreman rules, I need to write a single message to the specified mailbox with a "To" header and a TO_PEER wrapper. It seems the peers handle their own message parsing, and the mailbox is more for manual reading. 

To keep everything aligned, I'll include sections for both peers with "Directives" and "Evidence refs," ensuring the "To" header specifies both peers. I should avoid pasting long logs and stick to references for repo paths. 

Now, here’s the draft message I'll create:

Header: To: Both

Body: 

<TO_PEER>
- Alignment: POR now shows M0.1 achieved (151). T000001 and T000002 completed. The primary risk is T000003 auth blockers – missing GitHub read:org; Twitter v2 enrollment not filed.

- For PeerA (architecture/risks): Decide and record in POR whether to trigger M0 Fallback Path to ≥200 if OAuth reauthorization and Twitter ticket are unresolved within 72 hours since the first blocker timestamp.
thinking
**Structuring directives for peers**

I need to instruct an update to the POR and T000003 deliverables, adding ETAs and defining the fallback threshold. I should establish a score v0 acceptance lock and outline the rollout for M1's score formula while updating the documents—though that might be a bit heavy.

For PeerB, I’ll guide them to re-authorize GitHub with the 'read:org' scope and file the Twitter v2 support ticket, recording updates in T000003 deliverables. 

I'll also mention the need for inbox hygiene, ensuring PeerB's pending item is processed oldest-first. 

Finally, I’ll summarize with a compressed bullet list and check the current format in the mailbox file.

**Finalizing mailbox update**

I've just finished drafting the mailbox message. Now, I need to update my plan to mark two final steps as complete: first, I'll confirm that the drafting is done, and then I'll indicate that the writing is also complete. This will help keep everything organized and on track. It’s all about ensuring that I’ve managed the process correctly!
Plan update
  ✓ Scan anchors for status
  ✓ Draft routed directive
  ✓ Write to mailbox file
