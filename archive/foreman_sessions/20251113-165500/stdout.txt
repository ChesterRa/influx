Wrote a routed Foreman directive to peers with clear next steps.

- File: .cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md
- Route: To: Both, wrapped in <TO_PEER>…</TO_PEER>
- Items:
  - Item(align.m1.gate) → PeerA: Decide PASS/FAIL for Batch 0.5; if PASS, update POR.md and docs/por/T000004-m1-manual-scale/SUBPOR.md (Stage→active, REV note, Now/Next→Week 1). Evidence: .cccc/work/m1/batch05/velocity.log, .cccc/work/m1/batch05/pipeline.log
  - Item(impl.batch05→week1) → PeerB: Finish batch05 today (lists/seeds/m04-*.csv, harvest.filtered.jsonl, qa_sample.csv, export+CI green), then scaffold week1 (.cccc/work/m1/week1/, lists/seeds/m05-*.csv). Evidence: .cccc/work/m1/batch05/EXECUTION_PLAN.md
  - Item(risk.auth) → PeerA: Add “auth retry refusal condition” to POR risks. Evidence: docs/por/T000003-auth-unblock/SUBPOR.md, .cccc/work/validation/github_scope_infeasibility.md

Want me to also update the SUBPOR Stage to active and add the REV line now, or leave it for PeerA’s review?
