Okay, I will start by reviewing the project files to understand the current status and objectives.

Okay, I have reviewed the `PROJECT.md` and `docs/por/POR.md` files. It seems the project is to build an index of influential X/Twitter authors. 

The project recently recovered from a quality crisis where data was not being filtered correctly. A "single path" pipeline using `influx-harvest` has been established to ensure all data goes through the proper validation and filtering.

The current goal (M1) is to scale the dataset to 1.5k-2k authors. The immediate next step is to continue processing batches of authors to reach the next milestone of 400 authors.

I will now check the current status of the project by looking at the latest manifest file.

CLAIM: The project is back on track after a quality crisis. The immediate goal is to continue scaling the author list to 1.5k-2k, with the next milestone at 400. The `influx-harvest` tool is now the single, enforced pipeline for data ingestion to prevent future quality issues.
