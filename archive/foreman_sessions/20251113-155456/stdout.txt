Sent a concise directive to Both with immediate next steps.

- Wrote routed message: .cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md (auto-delivered to peer inboxes)
- Summary of asks:
  - PeerA (architecture/risks): Lock v1 filter contract in docs/por/d2-pipeline-contract.md (thresholds, CLI, acceptance, 1-command smoke test). Reference lists/rules/{brand_heuristics.yml,risk_terms.yml}.
  - PeerB (implementation): Wire filter enforcement in tools/influx-harvest, generate .cccc/work/m01/harvest.filtered.jsonl (≥40 records), validate via tools/influx-validate; keep logs in .cccc/work/.
- Context aligned to anchors:
  - POR (M1 pivot, Next-week filter enforcement): docs/por/POR.md
  - SUBPORs: T000001 (done), T000002 (done), T000003 (closed as infeasible)
  - TODO markers: tools/influx-harvest:53,80

If you want, I can next verify PeerB’s smoke run and update POR “Next” with evidence refs.
