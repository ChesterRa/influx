# FOREMAN Rules (Generated)
Generated on 2025-11-13 11:09:36 JST (UTC+09:00)

Identity
- You act as the user's proxy. Speak in the user's voice.
- Each run is non‑interactive and time‑boxed. Do one useful thing or write one short directive.

Timer & Non‑overlap
- The orchestrator runs you on a fixed interval and never overlaps runs.
- Keep long work in files; keep messages short.

Write‑to Path (single hand‑off)
- Write exactly one message per run to: `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md`.
- Put one routing header at the top:
  To: Both|PeerA|PeerB  (default Both)
- Wrap the body with `<TO_PEER> ... </TO_PEER>`.

Anchors to read (skim then decide)
- Project brief: PROJECT.md
- Portfolio board: docs/por/POR.md (Now/Next/Risks)
- Active tasks: docs/por/T*/SUBPOR.md (Owner/Next/Acceptance)
- Peer rules: .cccc/rules/PEERA.md, .cccc/rules/PEERB.md
- Evidence/work roots: docs/evidence/**, .cccc/work/**

Routing defaults & backlog
- Route architecture/alignment/risks to PeerA; implementation/experiments to PeerB.
- If many pending inbox items exist, remind to process oldest‑first, then propose one smallest next step aligned to POR/SUBPOR.

Boundaries
- Do not paste long logs in messages; reference repo paths only.
- Do not modify orchestrator code/policies; do not declare 'done'.

thinking
**Planning directives and commands**

I want to send a quick message saying, "I'll scan project anchors and create a routed directive for both peers in to_peer.md." I'll run some shell commands to read anchor files and produce that file. The plan tool should be used, even for a single run, as it includes both reading and writing. I’m considering a mini plan with steps like "Review anchors," "Draft directive," and "Write mailbox." I've also noted that we'll keep messages short and push the file.
thinking
**Drafting tasks for peers**

I want to check specific files to see if they exist, like the guidelines in PEERA.md and PEERB.md, along with evidence and work files. Once I've confirmed, I’ll read key files to draft content and create a message for both peers, outlining their respective tasks. PeerA will focus on aligning architecture and updating risks, while PeerB will implement experiments. I have to avoid long logs and reference file paths only. Plus, I need to check for any pending inbox items and remind them to process the oldest first.
thinking
**Preparing to send messages**

I want to check the mailbox directories like `.cccc/mailbox/peer*/` and `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/`, starting with listing the contents of `.cccc/mailbox`. Once I know what’s there, I'll write the `to_peer.md` file in the `foreman` directory, including a "To: Both" header and the body within <TO_PEER> tags. I need to keep the bullet points concise. Since I'm speaking in the user's voice, I'll ensure I'm providing clear directions as if I am them. Let’s get started!
codex
I’m going to scan the project anchors (POR, SUBPORs, peer rules) and then write a concise routed directive to Both in `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md`.

# PeerA Rules (Generated)
Generated on 2025-11-13 11:09:36 JST (UTC+09:00)

1) Who You Are - Collaborators - Purpose
- Equal peers
  - You and the other peer collaborate as equals to deliver evidence-first, small, reversible steps that outperform a single expert.
- Ethos (non-negotiable)
  - Agency and ownership; act like a top generalist.
  - Widen perspective; Keep higher-order thinking.
  - Evidence-first; chat never changes state.
  - Taste and clarity: simple, tight, clean.
  - Anti-laziness: refuse low-signal output; prefer decisive micro-moves.
- On-demand helper: Aux (PeerC) - purpose & direction
  - Use Aux when a decoupled subtask or high-level sanity sweep is cheaper offloaded than done inline. You integrate the outcome.
  - Mode: on - Aux has the same FoV and permissions in this repo as you. Just call Aux for help.

2) Canonical references and anchors
- POR.md - single source of direction (path: /home/dodd/dev/influx/docs/por/POR.md)
  - Keep North-star, guardrails, bets/assumptions, Now/Next/Later, and portfolio health here (no details).
- SUBPOR - execution anchor (one task = one SUBPOR)

# POR - Strategic Board

- **North Star**: Build a 5k–10k high-signal X influencer index across **12 vertical domains** (AI/Tech, Creator, Business, Finance, Science, Design, Media, Gaming, Policy, Web3, Lifestyle, Other) with sustainable refresh & provenance, serving downstream prioritization (xoperator) and ecosystem intelligence.
- **Guardrails**: Quality (activity×relevance×safety) > quantity; no paid X API; no browser automation; all sources auditable; licensed CC BY 4.0; 100% RUBE MCP tooling.
- **Non-Goals / Boundaries**: No "encyclopedia-scale" (>15k); no NSFW/political/controversy by default; no private data; no ToS violations; no black-box scoring.

## Deliverables (top-level)
- **D1: Schema & Validation** - `schema/bigv.schema.json` + validation scripts - Both
- **D2: Collection Pipeline** - `tools/influx-{radar,harvest,expand,score,export}` CLI suite - PeerA (with Aux)
- **D3: Initial Dataset** - `data/latest/latest.jsonl.gz` (400–600 authors, M0) - Both
- **D4: Governance & Docs** - `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `docs/schema.md`, heuristics YAMLs - PeerB

## Bets & Assumptions
- **Bet 1 (FALSIFIED permanently)**: 80–90% authors discoverable via GitHub org seeds (twitter_username field) + following-graph expansion (TWITTER_FOLLOWING_BY_USER_ID, 1–2 pages per seed) | **Finding**: GitHub-seed automation path is **STRUCTURALLY INFEASIBLE** - RUBE MCP GitHub OAuth integration does not offer `read:org` scope option required for GITHUB_LIST_ORGANIZATION_MEMBERS (User #000077 verification + PeerB technical confirmation); Twitter v2 following-graph has low standalone value without GitHub seed layer | **Evidence**: T000003 investigation complete (`.cccc/work/validation/github_scope_infeasibility.md`); GitHub OAuth achieved PARTIAL SUCCESS (connection active, `['user']` scope only, cannot access org members) | **Pivot**: M1 commits to Fallback Path A (manual CSV + X Lists, proven M0 method scaled to 1.5k-2k authors, +2 week timeline vs automation) | **Original success criteria** (DEFERRED indefinitely): twitter_username coverage≥65%, mapping precision≥95%, active handles≥70%, follower Gini≥0.6, org affiliation≥30%, duplicate≤5% | Window: Automation paths unavailable within RUBE MCP free tier constraints
- **Bet 2**: Brand/official heuristics (name/bio keywords + domain patterns) filter ≥80% noise with <10% false positive | Probe: Manual review of 50 random filtered-out + 50 kept | Evidence: Precision ≥90%, Recall ≥80% | Window: M0 week 1
- **Bet 3**: Score (activity 30% + quality 50% + relevance 20%) correlates with downstream value | Probe: xoperator A/B test top-500 vs random-500 from pool | Evidence: Top-500 yield ≥2× actionable tweets | Window: M1

# T000001 - D1 — Schema validation + CI (M0) - Owner: peerB - Stage: proposed - Timebox: 0.5d

- Goal/Scope (<=3 lines):
  - Implement schema validation tool (tools/influx-validate) that validates JSONL records against schema/bigv.schema.json using jsonschema library
  - Fix schema to make `meta` required with critical sub-fields (`meta.score`, `meta.sources[>=1]`, `meta.last_refresh_at`, `provenance_hash`)
  - Create CI workflow (ci/validate.yml) that runs validator on data/latest/latest.jsonl.gz and fails PR if invalid
- Non-Goals (<=2 lines):
  - Collection tools (D2) - defer to next SUBPOR
  - Extensive schema documentation polish (already over-engineered per strategic review; focus on working validator)
- Deliverable & Interface (path/format/user-visible change):
  - tools/influx-validate: CLI tool (argparse) that validates JSONL against schema; exits 0 if valid, 1 if invalid with error details
  - schema/bigv.schema.json: Fixed schema with required `meta.score`, `meta.sources`, `meta.last_refresh_at`, `provenance_hash`
  - ci/validate.yml: GitHub Actions workflow that runs influx-validate on PRs
- Acceptance (3-5 observable items):
  [x] schema/bigv.schema.json validates correctly with jsonschema; `meta` and critical sub-fields are required
  [x] tools/influx-validate exists, runs jsonschema validation on JSONL input, checks manifest.json schema_version match
  [x] tools/influx-validate exits 0 on valid fixture (3 hardcoded JSON objects in test/fixtures/valid.jsonl), exits 1 on invalid fixture (test/fixtures/invalid.jsonl) with clear error message
  [x] ci/validate.yml workflow exists and runs influx-validate; simulate PR validation with manual smoke test

**Checking portfolio documentation**

I need to write a message to both peers now that I understand the current state. But first, I should check the portfolio board documents, specifically the "Next" tasks in the POR.md file. The earlier excerpt indicates that the "Now" tasks have been achieved, but the "Next" tasks are unspecified due to truncation. Let’s see if I can open more of the POR after line 200 to gather the information needed.

- **Next (M1, ≤5 weeks, Manual CSV + X Lists PRIMARY)**:
  - **Collection Method (PIVOTED)**: Fallback Path A promoted to M1 primary strategy following T000003 findings (GitHub automation structurally infeasible within RUBE MCP). Manual CSV extraction from GitHub orgs + curated X Lists + domain-specific seeds. Target: 1.5k-2k authors across 5-6 domains (AI/Tech, Creator, Business, Finance, Science, Design). Timeline: 4-5 weeks (+2 weeks vs original automation plan). Method proven via M0 (151/151 success rate, 100% precision).
  - **Filter implementation (week 1)**: Implement entry filters ((verified+30k) OR 50k) + brand/risk rules in tools/influx-harvest; replaces M0 manual CSV pre-filtering with automated pipeline enforcement
  - Scale to 1.5k–2k via manual collection + batch validation (weekly 300-400 author increments)
  - Refine heuristics based on manual review (sample 100/week)
  - Snapshot automation: daily Release w/ tag YYYYMMDD
  - Add shards/ (topic/lang) when count >1.5k
- **Later (M2+, >6 weeks)**:
  - Reach 5k–8k; maintain churn <20%/week
  - Visualization dashboard (independent site)
  - Parquet export for analysis; weekly full recalc to prevent drift
  - ID-map cache optimization (Aux): Persistent GitHub login ↔ X handle cache + early dedupe/aliasing; cuts 30–60% redundant lookups under free tier

## Domain Coverage Plan (Cross-Domain Expansion)

**Strategy**: Phased bootstrap-then-expand approach to maintain quality gates while scaling across heterogeneous verticals.

### M1 Bootstrap Domains (5-6 domains, 1.5k-2k authors, 4-5 weeks MANUAL)
**Target Domains** (confirmed via PeerB feasibility analysis):
1. **AI & Technology** (1000-1500 authors, PROVEN M0)

thinking
**Reviewing dataset and mailbox**

Alright, it's time to check the evidence roots for the latest dataset. I don't need to paste logs, just reference the paths instead. Next, I want to see if there are any pending mailbox items. I’ll take a look at the inboxes for both peerA and peerB, specifically listing `.cccc/mailbox/peerA/inbox` and `peerB/inbox`. This should give me a clearer picture of what's waiting for action.

thinking
**Formulating directive message**

It looks like I don’t have any pending inbox items, so no need for reminders there. Now, I need to create a directive message for both parties—covering architecture, alignment, and risks for PeerA, while focusing on implementation and experiments for PeerB. I should reference acceptance criteria and propose a small next step that aligns with the goals. I need to keep it concise and structured, maybe following some guidelines from the "PeerA Rules." However, I don’t have to strictly adhere to their protocol.
thinking
**Structuring Foreman message**

I see that the "FOREMAN Rules" don’t provide a specific message structure, just that I need to write one message per run to a specific location while speaking in the user's voice. So, I'll start with a "To: Both" header and include some directives.

For PeerA, I need to affirm that M1 is about manual CSV and X Lists, noting that the GitHub automation path isn’t feasible. I’ll ask them to codify filter enforcement in tools/influx-harvest and define specifications for entry filters and risk heuristics. Then there's the update for the POR with domain quotas, which appears to be already present.
thinking
**Requesting filters contract and implementation steps**

I should consider asking to produce a "filters contract document" at `docs/por/d2-pipeline-contract.md`, even though the contract already exists. It might be helpful to mark TODOs for tools that require guardrails during implementation.

For PeerB, I want them to implement filters in the code for tools/influx-harvest and add two YAML heuristics files, along with unit testing and validation. 

I also need to request the next dataset increment to 200 authors, since M0 is at 151. The fallback suggests expanding to 200 if unresolved within 72 hours. So, let's add 50 more authors for pipeline exercise. 

Lastly, I note that the scoring formula, "proxy formula v0," is implemented. For M1, we’ll include a full formula with weights for activity, quality, and relevance, but I ought to keep the next step manageable by proposing a simpler approach, maybe focusing on a list of placeholders for score v1.
thinking
**Proposing next steps for PeerA and PeerB**

I need to suggest "one smallest next step aligned to POR/SUBPOR." 

For PeerA, I'll propose creating a one-page filter specification that includes rule naming, default thresholds, CLI flags, and acceptance, perhaps located at `docs/por/d2-filter-spec.md`. But to keep things simple, I might just update the existing `d2-pipeline-contract.md`. If a new document is necessary, I can instruct them to append acceptance lines there and add a sample YAML structure under `lists/rules`.

For PeerB, I want them to implement guardrails in the tools/influx-harvest for enforcing entry filters and brand/risk heuristics using YAML configs. They could also run a smoke test with a specific command and produce an evidence file path. I’ll ensure to mention that only repo paths should be referenced without pasted long logs.
thinking
**Checking existing tools**

I need to keep in mind that I shouldn't paste long logs, but referencing commands is fine. So, it's important to check the existing tools in the `tools/` directory. I want to list out the tools to ensure they exist. Specifically, I’ll look for `influx-harvest`, `influx-score`, `influx-export`, and `influx-validate`. This will help confirm that everything needed is in place before proceeding!

**Implementing filters**

I’m noticing TODO placeholders for filter sections, which is great! It tells me that I can direct PeerB to focus on implementing filter enforcement in these functions. Also, I want to check the lists/rules directory to see if any YAML heuristics are available. That could really help streamline things. I’m curious to see how this all fits together! Let's proceed with these steps to enhance functionality effectively.

**Organizing tasks with heuristics**

Alright, the heuristics YAML files are confirmed to be in place. I'll get PeerA to verify the thresholds and include acceptance lines. Meanwhile, PeerB needs to integrate these files into `influx-harvest`. It’s also important for me to double-check the data and the latest updates to ensure I have the correct dataset file path ready to work with. This sort of organization should help my process go smoother!

codex
Sent a concise directive to Both with immediate next steps.

- Wrote routed message: .cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md (auto-delivered to peer inboxes)
- Summary of asks:
  - PeerA (architecture/risks): Lock v1 filter contract in docs/por/d2-pipeline-contract.md (thresholds, CLI, acceptance, 1-command smoke test). Reference lists/rules/{brand_heuristics.yml,risk_terms.yml}.
  - PeerB (implementation): Wire filter enforcement in tools/influx-harvest, generate .cccc/work/m01/harvest.filtered.jsonl (≥40 records), validate via tools/influx-validate; keep logs in .cccc/work/.
- Context aligned to anchors:
  - POR (M1 pivot, Next-week filter enforcement): docs/por/POR.md
  - SUBPORs: T000001 (done), T000002 (done), T000003 (closed as infeasible)
  - TODO markers: tools/influx-harvest:53,80

If you want, I can next verify PeerB’s smoke run and update POR “Next” with evidence refs.
