Posted directive to peers with next steps and inbox nudge.

- Wrote `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md` with To: Both and <TO_PEER> wrapper.
- Directed PeerB to file Twitter v2 ticket using `.cccc/work/validation/twitter_v2_ticket.txt`, record ticket number back into `docs/por/T000003-auth-unblock/SUBPOR.md`, and ask PeerA to relay GitHub OAuth to user.
- Directed PeerA to update `docs/por/POR.md` Roadmap/Risks/Decision to mark auth as gating for M1.
- Nudged both to clear inbox oldest-first before acting.
