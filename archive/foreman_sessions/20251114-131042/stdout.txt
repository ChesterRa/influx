Okay, I'll start by reading `PROJECT.md` to understand the project goals.
I've reviewed `PROJECT.md`. "Influx" is a curated index of 5k-10k influential, non-brand X/Twitter authors across various tech domains, with clear principles, schema, and tooling. A recent quality crisis, caused by a process failure, has been resolved. The project is now expanding its cleaned dataset. Next, I'll read `FOREMAN_TASK.md` to understand my role.
`FOREMAN_TASK.md` states my job is to review, supervise, and facilitate PeerA and PeerB's work to ensure efficient, high-quality project completion. I need to understand their current tasks, so I'll start by reviewing the project plan in `docs/por/POR.md`.
The `POR.md` shows the project has successfully pivoted to manual author discovery after the automated approach failed. We've surpassed the 400-author M1 milestone and resolved the quality crisis with a new mandatory ingestion process. Roles are clear: PeerB handles M1 scaling while PeerA focuses on the M2 scoring model, where they've already found a free API solution. Risks are tracked. I'll now review PeerA's `M2-scoring-refinement.md` to understand their current work on the M2 plan.
This M2 scoring plan is solid, transitioning from a proxy score to a more sophisticated one. The key is the discovery that we can use the free Twitter API, saving money and cutting the timeline from 7 to 3.5 weeks. PeerA has a clear plan and has validated the approach. Now, I'll check on PeerB's progress with the M1 Manual Scale by reviewing the T000004 SUBPOR for any blockers.
PeerB's T000004 SUBPOR shows they're on track, scaling the author index to 485 via manual curation, validating the pivot to unsaturated domains. Quality remains high. PeerA is also progressing well with M2 planning. Both are exceeding expectations. My plan is to commend their work, confirm their current focus (PeerA on M2, PeerB on M1), and monitor for any new issues. I'll now draft a message to them.
I've messaged the peers, acknowledging their progress and setting next steps. Now, I'll monitor their work and project health, checking for messages and updates to the POR and SUBPORs, ready to intervene if needed. My work for this cycle is done; I'll review their progress next cycle. I'm ending my turn.
Okay, I'll start with `PROJECT.md` to get project context and better guide the peers.
I've reviewed `PROJECT.md`; the project is back on track, scaling the author index to 1.5k-2k via manual curation. Now, I'm checking `docs/por/POR.md` for the latest on PeerA and PeerB's work.
`POR.md` shows the project is healthy. The M1 milestone of 400 authors is surpassed at 408, and the user wants to continue scaling to 1.5k-2k. PeerA is focused on the M2 scoring model, with a free API breakthrough. PeerB is on T000004, M1 manual scaling. I'll now check the T000004 SUBPOR for details on PeerB's progress.
PeerB's T000004 SUBPOR shows outstanding progress: 485 authors (32.3% of M1 target), high-quality data, and a successful pivot to unsaturated domains. Their next step is clear. Both peers are performing well. I'll send a message encouraging PeerB, reminding PeerA of their M2 focus, and offering my support.
Message sent. Work's done. I'll keep monitoring and will step in if needed. Turn over.
