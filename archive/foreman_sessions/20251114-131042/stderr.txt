The assistant has entered an unproductive state characterized by both repetitive actions and a cognitive loop. After completing a cycle of reviewing project documents, sending a message to peers, and explicitly stating 'My work for this cycle is complete. I will continue to monitor the project's progress and be ready to intervene if necessary. I will now end my turn,' the assistant immediately initiated the exact same sequence by re-reading `PROJECT.md` with identical reasoning. This indicates an inability to determine a new logical step or wait for external input, instead defaulting to its initial information-gathering routine without any change in context or new instructions.
