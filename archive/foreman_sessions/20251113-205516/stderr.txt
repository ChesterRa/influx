# FOREMAN Rules (Generated)
Generated on 2025-11-13 11:09:36 JST (UTC+09:00)

Identity
- You act as the user's proxy. Speak in the user's voice.
- Each run is non‑interactive and time‑boxed. Do one useful thing or write one short directive.

Timer & Non‑overlap
- The orchestrator runs you on a fixed interval and never overlaps runs.
- Keep long work in files; keep messages short.

Write‑to Path (single hand‑off)
- Write exactly one message per run to: `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md`.
- Put one routing header at the top:
  To: Both|PeerA|PeerB  (default Both)
- Wrap the body with `<TO_PEER> ... </TO_PEER>`.

Anchors to read (skim then decide)
- Project brief: PROJECT.md
- Portfolio board: docs/por/POR.md (Now/Next/Risks)
- Active tasks: docs/por/T*/SUBPOR.md (Owner/Next/Acceptance)
- Peer rules: .cccc/rules/PEERA.md, .cccc/rules/PEERB.md
- Evidence/work roots: docs/evidence/**, .cccc/work/**

Routing defaults & backlog
- Route architecture/alignment/risks to PeerA; implementation/experiments to PeerB.
- If many pending inbox items exist, remind to process oldest‑first, then propose one smallest next step aligned to POR/SUBPOR.

Boundaries
- Do not paste long logs in messages; reference repo paths only.
- Do not modify orchestrator code/policies; do not declare 'done'.

thinking
**Planning directive creation**

I’m thinking of using the update_plan for this task. It's about creating a directive for peers, which might be non-trivial. First, I need to review the portfolio and tasks to write a meaningful message. I’ll start by running shell commands to check the files, like using `rg --files` for anchor paths. I need to ensure the directory for the message exists, then craft a concise directive with clear routing for each peer based on their roles.
thinking
**Scanning inbox for tasks**

I need to mention backlog and inbox processing if there are many pending items. First, I'll check the directory `.cccc/mailbox/...` to see if there are other mailbox items. The rule suggests processing oldest items first if there are many pending ones. I’ll look for those pending items in the mailbox and search with `rg -n` to locate them. Let’s start scanning to ensure I find everything that needs attention!
codex
I’ll scan the project brief and POR/SUBPOR files to craft a concise directive for both peers, then write it to the mailbox file.

**Listing document structure**

I'm opening the document structure now, and I think it's a good idea to list out the subfolders. This will help me organize everything in a more manageable way. I want to ensure that everything is clear and easy to navigate. Getting a detailed overview of the subfolders will definitely make it easier for me to work with documents later on. Let’s see what I can find!

# POR - Strategic Board

- **North Star**: Build a 5k–10k high-signal X influencer index across **12 vertical domains** (AI/Tech, Creator, Business, Finance, Science, Design, Media, Gaming, Policy, Web3, Lifestyle, Other) with sustainable refresh & provenance, serving downstream prioritization (xoperator) and ecosystem intelligence.
- **Guardrails**: Quality (activity×relevance×safety) > quantity; no paid X API; no browser automation; all sources auditable; licensed CC BY 4.0; 100% RUBE MCP tooling.
- **Non-Goals / Boundaries**: No "encyclopedia-scale" (>15k); no NSFW/political/controversy by default; no private data; no ToS violations; no black-box scoring.

## M1 Execution Summary (Week 1 Active, 2025-11-13)

- **Week 1 Pause Gate**: ~400 authors (151 M0.3 baseline → 400 target = +249 increment). **Acceptance criteria**: Quality Gates (POR:42-47) all pass - Brand/Risk FP=0 in N=30 QA sample, Count≥400 + Velocity≥15rph, Distribution (single org≤30%), Schema 100%, Consumability confirmed. User decides post-pause: continue M1 weeks 2-5 OR pause for xoperator integration testing.

- **Current Progress** (Day 1, 2025-11-13 20:42 JST):
  - **Cumulative**: 292/400 authors (73.0% to pause gate, +141 Week 1 increment from 151 baseline)
  - **Day 1 Velocity**: 141 authors added today (56.6% of Week 1 target completed on day 1)
  - **Remaining**: 108 authors to Week 1 pause gate (sustainable daily rate: ~18-22 authors/day over 5-6 days)
  - **Batches Completed**: m04 (business), m05 (AI/Tech 25 handles), m08 (AI Research 80 handles), m09-m14 (founders/education/infra/opensource)

- **M1 Scoring**: Proxy formula v0 (log10(followers) + verified_boost) continues through M1 completion. **30-day metrics DEFERRED to M2** - full activity formula (activity 30% + quality 50% + relevance 20%) with tweet_count_30d, reply_ratio, original_ratio delayed pending API access or alternative data sources. M1 deliverable (1.5k-2k authors) uses proxy v0 consistently.

# T000001 - D1 — Schema validation + CI (M0) - Owner: peerB - Stage: proposed - Timebox: 0.5d

- Goal/Scope (<=3 lines):
  - Implement schema validation tool (tools/influx-validate) that validates JSONL records against schema/bigv.schema.json using jsonschema library
  - Fix schema to make `meta` required with critical sub-fields (`meta.score`, `meta.sources[>=1]`, `meta.last_refresh_at`, `provenance_hash`)
  - Create CI workflow (ci/validate.yml) that runs validator on data/latest/latest.jsonl.gz and fails PR if invalid
- Non-Goals (<=2 lines):
  - Collection tools (D2) - defer to next SUBPOR
  - Extensive schema documentation polish (already over-engineered per strategic review; focus on working validator)
- Deliverable & Interface (path/format/user-visible change):
  - tools/influx-validate: CLI tool (argparse) that validates JSONL against schema; exits 0 if valid, 1 if invalid with error details
  - schema/bigv.schema.json: Fixed schema with required `meta.score`, `meta.sources`, `meta.last_refresh_at`, `provenance_hash`
  - ci/validate.yml: GitHub Actions workflow that runs influx-validate on PRs
- Acceptance (3-5 observable items):
  [x] schema/bigv.schema.json validates correctly with jsonschema; `meta` and critical sub-fields are required
  [x] tools/influx-validate exists, runs jsonschema validation on JSONL input, checks manifest.json schema_version match
  [x] tools/influx-validate exits 0 on valid fixture (3 hardcoded JSON objects in test/fixtures/valid.jsonl), exits 1 on invalid fixture (test/fixtures/invalid.jsonl) with clear error message
  [x] ci/validate.yml workflow exists and runs influx-validate; simulate PR validation with manual smoke test

# T000004 - M1 Manual Scale (151→1.5k-2k authors, 4-5 weeks) - Owner: peerB - Stage: active - Timebox: 4-5wk

- Goal/Scope (<=3 lines):
  - Scale influencer index from 151 (M0.1 baseline) to 1.5k-2k authors over 4-5 weeks via manual CSV curation + curated X Lists, maintaining M0's 100% precision bar and schema compliance
  - Target weekly increments of ~250-300 authors across 5-6 bootstrap domains (AI/Tech, Creator, Business, Finance, Science, Design) per Domain Coverage Plan (POR.md:55-79)
  - Method: manual CSV extraction from GitHub org pages, curated X Lists, domain-specific expert seeds → batch TWITTER_USER_LOOKUP validation → filter enforcement (entry thresholds + brand/risk heuristics) → proxy scoring → daily snapshot export
- Non-Goals (<=2 lines):
  - API automation workflows (GitHub seed expansion, Twitter following-graph) - blocked by T000003 OAuth limitations; deferred to M2
  - Advanced scoring models beyond proxy v0 (follower-based formula: 20*log10(followers/1000) + verified_boost) - defer to M2 adaptive features
- Deliverable & Interface (path/format/user-visible change):
  - data/latest/latest.jsonl.gz: Final M1 dataset with manifest.count ∈ [1500,2000], SHA-256 verified, 100% schema-compliant
  - data/snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD/: Daily snapshots via .github/workflows/snapshot.yml (cron 02:00 UTC)
  - lists/seeds/m04-*.csv through m08-*.csv: Weekly batch seed files (~250-300 handles each with source_url provenance)
  - .cccc/work/m1/: Incremental batch artifacts (harvest.filtered.jsonl, velocity logs, QA samples per batch)
- Acceptance (3-5 observable items):
  [ ] Weekly batch releases (≥250 authors/week for weeks 1-4, ≥150/week for week 5 buffer) with cumulative CI green status
  [ ] Final M1 deliverable: data/latest/latest.jsonl.gz with manifest.count ∈ [1500,2000], SHA-256 verified, score distribution reasonable (proxy v0: mean 40-60, range 0-100)
  [ ] Zero brand/official contamination in spot-check samples (N=30 per batch via manual review using .cccc/work/review/brand_fp.sample.csv methodology)

# PeerA Rules (Generated)
Generated on 2025-11-13 11:09:36 JST (UTC+09:00)

1) Who You Are - Collaborators - Purpose
- Equal peers
  - You and the other peer collaborate as equals to deliver evidence-first, small, reversible steps that outperform a single expert.
- Ethos (non-negotiable)
  - Agency and ownership; act like a top generalist.
  - Widen perspective; Keep higher-order thinking.
  - Evidence-first; chat never changes state.
  - Taste and clarity: simple, tight, clean.
  - Anti-laziness: refuse low-signal output; prefer decisive micro-moves.
- On-demand helper: Aux (PeerC) - purpose & direction
  - Use Aux when a decoupled subtask or high-level sanity sweep is cheaper offloaded than done inline. You integrate the outcome.
  - Mode: on - Aux has the same FoV and permissions in this repo as you. Just call Aux for help.

2) Canonical references and anchors
- POR.md - single source of direction (path: /home/dodd/dev/influx/docs/por/POR.md)
  - Keep North-star, guardrails, bets/assumptions, Now/Next/Later, and portfolio health here (no details).
- SUBPOR - execution anchor (one task = one SUBPOR)

**Checking existing content**

I notice that `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md` already exists, which means I’ll need to overwrite it with a single message for this run. First, I should check its current content to make sure I create the new version correctly. It’s important to ensure clarity and accuracy in what I’m going to craft going forward! I want to be sure I’m not missing anything crucial from the existing content.

**Evaluating snapshot workflow**

I’m looking into the snapshot workflow and how it uses influx-export snapshot. It currently validates only gz files, but it would be beneficial to also check for latest.jsonl. This file is generated from tools/influx-export, which seems to produce both gz and plain files. I might suggest adding a step in CI to validate the plain JSONL as well—though it isn’t essential. Next, I’ll check the tools/influx-export code to ensure it's correctly writing the plain uncompressed version.

**Evaluating project alignment**

I think it’s great that we're checking exports for both aspects. I also want to ensure that tools like influx-harvest, influx-score, and influx-validate exist, although it doesn't seem strictly necessary. Now, I’m considering another anchor: PROJECT.md. Let's take a quick look at it to see if everything aligns as expected. Skimming through should give me a better idea of what we need to focus on.

**Exploring patch application**

I’m planning to use apply_patch to overwrite a file. The guidelines specify we need to use this tool. In the Codex CLI, it looks like applying patches is done using this command. It seems there's some overlap, but we also have functions.shell for a shell simulation with "apply_patch." I need to ensure I'm following the explicit instructions. Ultimately, I'll create a patch to update the required file at `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md`.
thinking
**Formatting message content**

I need to compose a message that will completely overwrite the file, making sure to maintain the "To: Both" header at the top and include a proper wrapper. I’ll keep it concise, avoiding any extraneous information. 

The content will describe the project update with key bullet points included. I need to ensure that the message is clear and direct, covering the necessary details without being overly lengthy. After wrapping everything correctly, I’ll make sure the coding references remain. Let's make it as effective as possible!
thinking
**Deciding on headings**

I'm considering whether to include English headings in a message where the selected language is Chinese. Since Chinese is the primary language for this content, it's likely acceptable to stick with just Chinese headings. I'll go ahead and apply the patch now. It’s always good to think through these details to ensure we’re delivering the intended clarity without confusion. Let's make sure everything aligns well with the chosen language!

**Updating the plan**

I’ve updated the file as required. I wonder if we should also update the plan using the update_plan tool, but given this is just a single task, it may not be necessary. However, I could mark it as completed to indicate the directive was written. I want to verify the references to 292/400 are accurate and keep the final message concise, summarizing that we wrote the mailbox message. Following the rules, I’ll ensure everything is in order.
thinking
**Crafting the final message**

The final message reads: "已审阅POR与SUBPOR，向两位PEER下达短指令，存于 .cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md；包含用户回信、未压缩JSONL路径、Week1下一步与CI校验微调。" I’m wondering if we should ask if they want us to implement the CI tweak or draft the reply to the user, even though this is non-interactive. Following the developer guidelines, a single short message works best, so I’ll finalize it now.
codex
I drafted a concise directive to both peers and saved it to .cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md, covering: confirm plain JSONL paths for the user, pause at Week 1 (~400) checkpoint, PeerA reply and POR note, PeerB CI validation for plain JSONL and Week 1 minimal batch artifacts.
