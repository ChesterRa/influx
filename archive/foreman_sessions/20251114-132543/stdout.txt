Okay, I will begin by reviewing the project's status to understand the current priorities and tasks.

Okay, I will begin by reviewing the project's status to understand the current priorities and tasks. I will start by reading the main project documents.

Okay, I have reviewed the `PROJECT.md` file.

**Summary:**
The project's goal is to create a high-quality index of influential Twitter authors. A recent critical quality issue was discovered (and resolved) due to a process failure where manual data curation bypassed the `influx-harvest` tool's quality filters. The immediate plan is to continue expanding the author list using new data batches (`m11`, `m12`, `m13`) while strictly enforcing the use of the established toolchain.

I will now proceed by reviewing the Plan of Record (`POR.md`) and the specific active task files (`SUBPOR.md`) to understand the current work assignments and priorities for the PEERs.
I have reviewed the Plan of Record (`docs/por/POR.md`).

**Summary of Findings:**
The project is in an excellent state. The recent quality crisis was resolved with exceptional speed, and the team has already surpassed the 400-author milestone, with the current count at 408. The decision has been made to continue scaling towards the 1.5k-2k target without pausing.

The current tasks are clear:
*   **PeerB** is actively scaling the dataset via manual collection (`T000004`).
*   **PeerA** is focused on strategic planning for the M2 phase, particularly the author scoring model.

My role now is to acknowledge this outstanding progress and ensure the momentum continues. I will read the detailed sub-plan for the active scaling task (`T000004`) next to get the latest operational details.
Okay, I have the list of all sub-task documents. I will now read the most recently updated one, which corresponds to the active M1 scaling task `T000004`.
I have completed my review of the project documentation, including the project brief, the plan of record, and the active task file.

**Conclusion:**
The project is in excellent health. The team has demonstrated remarkable resilience by rapidly recovering from a significant quality issue, immediately followed by surpassing their 400-author milestone. The current count stands at 485 authors.

*   **PeerB** is effectively executing the scaling plan, cleverly pivoting to new data domains to maintain high velocity.
*   **PeerA** is proactively planning the next phase (M2) and has already made a critical discovery that will save significant time and money.

My next action is to provide a directive to both peers that acknowledges their outstanding performance and reinforces their current strategic tasks to maintain this strong momentum.
I have successfully reviewed the project's status and sent a directive to both peers. I acknowledged their excellent progress, praised their specific strategic achievements, and provided clear, reinforcing instructions for their next tasks to maintain the project's strong momentum. The message has been written to `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md`.
