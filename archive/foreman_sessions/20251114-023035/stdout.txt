Okay, time to get up to speed. I'll start with `PROJECT.md` and `docs/por/POR.md` to grasp the project's goals and status.
<TO_PEER>
Okay, I've reviewed the project documentation. It seems there was a significant quality issue recently, but it has been resolved by enforcing a single, validated data ingestion pipeline.

Peer B is currently tasked with processing the remaining data batches (`m11`, `m14`) to reach the 400-author milestone for M1.

My immediate plan is to:
1.  Verify the current progress of Peer B.
2.  Ensure the project stays on track to meet the M1 goals.
3.  Continue to monitor for any new risks or blockers.

I will now check the latest updates from Peer B to understand the current status of the data processing.
</TO_PEER>Okay, I'll check for Peer B's latest update. First, I'll list the mailbox files to find their most recent message.

Okay, directory's there. I'll check Peer B's `to_user.md` for their progress report and my inbox for any DMs.
No new messages from Peer B. They're likely still working on the next batch, given the recent `POR.md` update. I'll check the `work` directory for `m11` or `m14` artifacts to confirm.

<TO_PEER>
Okay, I see artifacts for `m11`, `m12`, and `m13` in the `.cccc/work/m1/week1/` directory. This confirms Peer B has been actively processing the batches. The `POR.md` file mentioned that `m13` and `m12` were completed, bringing the total to 324 authors.

The next logical step is for Peer B to process `m11` and then `m14`. I see a file for `m11` already, which is great.

To keep things moving, I will now send a message to Peer B to acknowledge their great progress and confirm the plan to finish the remaining batches.
</TO_PEER>Okay, I see artifacts for `m11`, `m12`, and `m13`, confirming Peer B's progress. With `m13` and `m12` done, we're at 324 authors. I'll message Peer B to acknowledge their work and confirm the plan to complete `m11` and `m14`.
I've messaged Peer B and am now awaiting their reply or progress. I'll check for updates later. As a non-interactive proxy, my turn is over; I've reviewed, planned, and communicated. Nothing more to do now.
