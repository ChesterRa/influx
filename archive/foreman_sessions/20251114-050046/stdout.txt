Okay, I will start by reviewing the project files to understand the current status and objectives.

Okay, I have reviewed the `PROJECT.md` and `docs/por/POR.md` files. It seems the project is to build an index of influential X/Twitter authors. 

The project recently recovered from a quality crisis where data was not being filtered correctly. A "single path" ingestion pipeline using `influx-harvest` has been established to fix this.

The current goal (M1) is to scale the dataset to 1.5k-2k authors. The immediate next step is to continue processing batches of authors, starting with `m03-additional-batch.csv` and `m03-final-top-tier.csv`.

I will now check the `SUBPOR` for the active task T000004 to get more details on the current execution status.
