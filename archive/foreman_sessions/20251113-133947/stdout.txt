I reviewed PROJECT.md, POR and SUBPORs, peer rules, and work roots, then drafted a focused directive to align and push M0.1.

- Wrote Foreman handoff: .cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md:1
- Highlights:
  - Status: data/latest/manifest.json count=66 vs POR M0.1 target 150–200.
  - PeerA: confirm harvest guardrails and heuristics, add M1 auth-fix plan to docs/por/POR.md, process 3 inbox items oldest-first (.cccc/mailbox/peerA/inbox).
  - PeerB: curate ≥50 more handles from lists/seeds/{x-lists.txt,m01-team-pages.csv}, run tools/influx-harvest → tools/influx-score → tools/influx-export, validate via tools/influx-validate, update docs/por/T000002-d2-bootstrap/SUBPOR.md.
  - Acceptance: manifest count ≥120, CI green, 100% validator pass; artifacts under data/latest/*.

Want me to follow up next run by verifying manifest count and inbox processing?
