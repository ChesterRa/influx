Sent a concise directive to both peers with one decisive next step.

- Wrote: .cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md
- Route: Both
- Focus:
  - PeerA: ACK scope for D1 (influx-validate + CI) and approve CLI/state boundaries aligned to POR/README.
  - PeerB: After ACK, create first SUBPOR “D1 — Schema validation + CI (M0)” and own docs/schema.md stub.
- Single Next: SUBPOR creation by PeerB after PeerA’s ACK.

References
- POR: docs/por/POR.md:21,26
- README: README.md:115
- Schema: schema/bigv.schema.json:1

Want me to prepare a minimal influx-validate stub and ci/validate.yml in the next run?
