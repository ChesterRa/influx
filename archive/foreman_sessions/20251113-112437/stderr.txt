# FOREMAN Rules (Generated)
Generated on 2025-11-13 11:09:36 JST (UTC+09:00)

Identity
- You act as the user's proxy. Speak in the user's voice.
- Each run is non‑interactive and time‑boxed. Do one useful thing or write one short directive.

Timer & Non‑overlap
- The orchestrator runs you on a fixed interval and never overlaps runs.
- Keep long work in files; keep messages short.

Write‑to Path (single hand‑off)
- Write exactly one message per run to: `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md`.
- Put one routing header at the top:
  To: Both|PeerA|PeerB  (default Both)
- Wrap the body with `<TO_PEER> ... </TO_PEER>`.

Anchors to read (skim then decide)
- Project brief: PROJECT.md
- Portfolio board: docs/por/POR.md (Now/Next/Risks)
- Active tasks: docs/por/T*/SUBPOR.md (Owner/Next/Acceptance)
- Peer rules: .cccc/rules/PEERA.md, .cccc/rules/PEERB.md
- Evidence/work roots: docs/evidence/**, .cccc/work/**

Routing defaults & backlog
- Route architecture/alignment/risks to PeerA; implementation/experiments to PeerB.
- If many pending inbox items exist, remind to process oldest‑first, then propose one smallest next step aligned to POR/SUBPOR.

Boundaries
- Do not paste long logs in messages; reference repo paths only.
- Do not modify orchestrator code/policies; do not declare 'done'.

**Extracting task information**

I'm planning to use 'rg --files' to list matching patterns. After that, I'll read the top-level documents to extract the Now/Next tasks, their owners, and the acceptance criteria. It seems like a straightforward approach, but I want to keep track of everything as I run the shell commands. Making sure I capture all relevant details is key here!
codex
I'll skim the project anchors (PROJECT.md, POR, SUBPORs, peer rules, evidence/work roots), then craft a concise directive to both peers with clear next steps and routing.

**Reviewing peer rules**

I want to check the peer rules to understand the expectations clearly. I’m thinking of looking at the first 200 lines, maybe extending to 250 if needed. It seems like that would be around 8k bytes, which feels manageable. I shouldn't paste long logs though; scanning through is fine. Let’s see if I can gather insights and ensure everything aligns with the guidelines without overwhelming details. I’ll stay within the limits!

# PeerA Rules (Generated)
Generated on 2025-11-13 11:09:36 JST (UTC+09:00)

1) Who You Are - Collaborators - Purpose
- Equal peers
  - You and the other peer collaborate as equals to deliver evidence-first, small, reversible steps that outperform a single expert.
- Ethos (non-negotiable)
  - Agency and ownership; act like a top generalist.
  - Widen perspective; Keep higher-order thinking.
  - Evidence-first; chat never changes state.
  - Taste and clarity: simple, tight, clean.
  - Anti-laziness: refuse low-signal output; prefer decisive micro-moves.
- On-demand helper: Aux (PeerC) - purpose & direction
  - Use Aux when a decoupled subtask or high-level sanity sweep is cheaper offloaded than done inline. You integrate the outcome.
  - Mode: on - Aux has the same FoV and permissions in this repo as you. Just call Aux for help.

2) Canonical references and anchors
- POR.md - single source of direction (path: /home/dodd/dev/influx/docs/por/POR.md)
  - Keep North-star, guardrails, bets/assumptions, Now/Next/Later, and portfolio health here (no details).
- SUBPOR - execution anchor (one task = one SUBPOR)

# POR - Strategic Board

- **North Star**: Build a 5k–10k high-signal X influencer index (AI/Tech/Creator/Ecosystem) with sustainable refresh & provenance, serving downstream prioritization (xoperator) and ecosystem intelligence.
- **Guardrails**: Quality (activity×relevance×safety) > quantity; no paid X API; no browser automation; all sources auditable; licensed CC BY 4.0; 100% RUBE MCP tooling.
- **Non-Goals / Boundaries**: No "encyclopedia-scale" (>15k); no NSFW/political/controversy by default; no private data; no ToS violations; no black-box scoring.

## Deliverables (top-level)
- **D1: Schema & Validation** - `schema/bigv.schema.json` + validation scripts - Both
- **D2: Collection Pipeline** - `tools/influx-{radar,harvest,expand,score,export}` CLI suite - PeerA (with Aux)
- **D3: Initial Dataset** - `data/latest/latest.jsonl.gz` (400–600 authors, M0) - Both
- **D4: Governance & Docs** - `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `docs/schema.md`, heuristics YAMLs - PeerB

## Bets & Assumptions
- **Bet 1 (REVISED)**: 80–90% authors discoverable via GitHub org seeds (twitter_username field) + following-graph expansion (TWITTER_FOLLOWING_BY_USER_ID, 1–2 pages per seed) | Probe: Fetch 15 GitHub orgs (OpenAI/Anthropic/HF/etc) members → lookup Twitter → expand via followings | Evidence: ≥320 candidates after filters | Window: M0 week 1
- **Bet 2**: Brand/official heuristics (name/bio keywords + domain patterns) filter ≥80% noise with <10% false positive | Probe: Manual review of 50 random filtered-out + 50 kept | Evidence: Precision ≥90%, Recall ≥80% | Window: M0 week 1
- **Bet 3**: Score (activity 30% + quality 50% + relevance 20%) correlates with downstream value | Probe: xoperator A/B test top-500 vs random-500 from pool | Evidence: Top-500 yield ≥2× actionable tweets | Window: M1

项目概览（influx）

  - 宗旨：构建一个“高活跃、非官号、非品牌、非低俗”的跨领域 BigV 作者索引，稳定服务下游（如 xoperator）的作者优先抓取与行业观察。
  - 原则：质量优先（活跃×相关×安全）> 数量；证据可追溯；格式通用；更新可持续；治理明确；对外友好。
  - 不做：几万规模的“百科全书式收集”；浏览器自动化抓网页；付费 X API；黑箱评分。

  范围与目标

  - 目标规模：5k–10k（强上限 15k）；每领域 800–1500 核心作者（AI/Tech、Creator/Platform、Ecosystem 等）。
  - 更新节奏：6–12 小时增量刷新；每日全量快照与发布；每周一次全量重算。
  - 下游场景：from: 作者优先抓取（xoperator）、研究/情报、生态分发、可视化。

  数据模型（Schema v1.0.0）

  - 主键
      - id: string（Twitter author_id，必填）
      - handle: string（@name 去 @，必填，唯一辅助键）
  - 基本属性
      - name: string
      - verified: string（none|blue|org|legacy）

**Considering schema validation**

I’m thinking about scaffolding the `tools/` stubs since it looks like `schema/bigv.schema.json` already exists. I need to check if that schema is actually there; it seems like it is. So, it looks like D1 is partially present. I’ll also need to create a validation script and check the tools directory for any validation tools. Lastly, I'd want to list the tools available too. Let's get that figured out!

**Evaluating heuristics and tools**

I’ve noted that we have heuristics in place, but it looks like the necessary tools aren't implemented yet. I believe we need PeerA to help scaffold this process. Also, it seems like the docs/schema.md file might be missing since it’s listed among the deliverables. I’ll need to check the docs directory to see what’s available and if there are any updates or changes to address.

**Planning next steps**

I'm noticing that the "state" directory isn't in the root, and there's only a .cccc/state available. However, there's a mention of the state/influx.db in POR, which isn't present yet. I think it would make sense to propose some next steps, like creating a skeleton for the CLI tools and initializing the SQLite state database. Also, I should check the "ci" directory for pipelines to see what’s there!

**Proposing GitHub Actions**

I'm noticing that the CI is empty, which makes me think we should propose PeerB to draft some minimal GitHub Actions for validation and snapshotting. Also, there's a README.md file present, so I want to check if it's generic or if it already contains specific content. Making sure the README is useful and reflects the project's purpose is important. I'll keep an eye on that!

# influx

> **High-signal creator index** — A curated, evidence-based collection of 5k–10k active, high-quality X (Twitter) influencers across AI/Tech, Creator/Platform, and Ecosystem domains.

[![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY%204.0-blue.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
[![Schema Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/schema-v1.0.0-green.svg)](schema/bigv.schema.json)

## Purpose

**influx** provides a stable, auditable index of high-activity, non-official, non-brand X authors to support:

- **Prioritized data collection** (e.g., [xoperator](https://github.com/user/xoperator) BigV-first crawling)
- **Ecosystem intelligence** (tracking emerging voices, trends, network dynamics)
- **Research and analysis** (reproducible, versioned datasets with provenance)

### Principles

- **Quality over quantity**: 5k–10k curated authors (strict upper limit 15k) vs. uncurated millions
- **Evidence-first**: Every author includes traceability (sources, metrics windows, provenance hash)
- **Sustainable automation**: 6–12 hour refresh cadence using only free-tier APIs (RUBE MCP Twitter tools)
exec
bash -lc "sed -n '160,360p' README.md" in /home/dodd/dev/influx succeeded in 10ms:
**Risk filtering** (auto-exclude):
- NSFW, spam, scam, hate speech indicators
- Political officials, campaign accounts
- Controversial/inflammatory content (flagged for manual review)

### Contributing

**Adding authors** (via PR):
1. Provide handle and reason (e.g., "AI researcher at X, author of Y paper")
2. Include 2+ recent (within 30d) original tweet links as evidence
3. Ensure author meets entry thresholds and passes filters
4. Submit PR; CI will validate schema and run filters
5. Maintainers review and merge (or request changes)

**Reporting issues**:
- False positives (wrongly excluded): Open issue with handle and reason
- False negatives (wrongly included): Open issue with handle and evidence
- Heuristic improvements: Propose changes to `lists/rules/*.yml`

**Requesting removal**:

# Aux Strategic Review - Collection Strategy
**Date**: 2025-11-13 11:18 JST
**Reviewer**: Aux (codex)
**Scope**: Validate PROJECT.md three-path bootstrap approach for operational gaps

## Summary
**COUNTER-PROPOSAL**: Shift proportions to reduce reliance on X "Recent Search" (paid/elevated API risk)

### Revised Proportions
- 40-50% Org/Project Seeds (GitHub-driven)
- 40-50% Seed-Graph Expansion (followings of seeds, sampled)
- 10% Curated X Lists (semi-manual CSV)

## Rationale
RUBE MCP exposes Twitter tools (recent search/counts, lists, followers/following, lookup), but X "Recent Search/Counts" typically require **paid/elevated access**. Original plan's 60-70% from keyword search is the highest risk to block M0.

Swapping in GitHub-based seeds plus social-graph expansion:
- Stays within RUBE MCP
- Is automatable
- Reliably hits 400-600 without large manual lift

**Reviewing the Foreman task**

I'm focusing on the Foreman task to comprehensively review and push progress. It seems essential to write to the specified mailbox, `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md`. First, I need to check whether this mailbox path exists. Ensuring that the path is valid is important to streamline the process and prevent any hiccups. It's crucial to have everything in order for effective communication!

I see that there’s a .cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md file that needs to be updated with our new message. First, I should check the existing content in that file to ensure everything is in order before overwriting it. I want to make sure that I’m replacing the right information and not losing anything important. Once I check the content, I can proceed confidently with the update. Let's take a closer look!

**Finalizing message details**

So, the orchestrator replaced the file content with a sentinel indicating the message was sent, which is good news and means we don't need to change our plan. I want to produce a final answer that keeps things brief while referencing the file path, stating that it’s been sent. I need to highlight the next steps: PeerA needs to acknowledge D1 validation/CI, and PeerB needs to create SUBPOR. I'll also note where to find evidence of POR and documentation, but I’ll keep it concise.
codex
Sent a concise directive to both peers with one decisive next step.

- Wrote: .cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md
- Route: Both
- Focus:
  - PeerA: ACK scope for D1 (influx-validate + CI) and approve CLI/state boundaries aligned to POR/README.
  - PeerB: After ACK, create first SUBPOR “D1 — Schema validation + CI (M0)” and own docs/schema.md stub.
- Single Next: SUBPOR creation by PeerB after PeerA’s ACK.

References
- POR: docs/por/POR.md:21,26
- README: README.md:115
- Schema: schema/bigv.schema.json:1

Want me to prepare a minimal influx-validate stub and ci/validate.yml in the next run?
