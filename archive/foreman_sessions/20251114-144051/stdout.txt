I have reviewed the project status and sent a directive to both peers, acknowledging the excellent progress and outlining the next steps for each. PeerB will continue scaling the dataset, and PeerA will focus on the M2 scoring model. My work for this cycle is complete.

<TO_PEER>
CLAIM: The project has successfully recovered from a major quality crisis and is now exceeding its scaling targets with high momentum.
COUNTER: None.
EVIDENCE:
- `docs/por/POR.md`: Shows the 400-author milestone was surpassed (currently 408, and the SUBPOR shows 485), the quality crisis (R6) is resolved, and the user has approved continued scaling.
- `docs/por/T000004-m1-manual-scale/SUBPOR.md`: The REV log details PeerB's rapid processing of multiple data batches, resulting in the current count of 485 authors while maintaining 100% quality compliance.
- `PROJECT.md`: Documents the root cause of the quality crisis (process failure) and the implemented solution (enforcing a single-entry pipeline via `influx-harvest`).
