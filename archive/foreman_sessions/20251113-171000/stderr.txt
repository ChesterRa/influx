# FOREMAN Rules (Generated)
Generated on 2025-11-13 11:09:36 JST (UTC+09:00)

Identity
- You act as the user's proxy. Speak in the user's voice.
- Each run is non‑interactive and time‑boxed. Do one useful thing or write one short directive.

Timer & Non‑overlap
- The orchestrator runs you on a fixed interval and never overlaps runs.
- Keep long work in files; keep messages short.

Write‑to Path (single hand‑off)
- Write exactly one message per run to: `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md`.
- Put one routing header at the top:
  To: Both|PeerA|PeerB  (default Both)
- Wrap the body with `<TO_PEER> ... </TO_PEER>`.

Anchors to read (skim then decide)
- Project brief: PROJECT.md
- Portfolio board: docs/por/POR.md (Now/Next/Risks)
- Active tasks: docs/por/T*/SUBPOR.md (Owner/Next/Acceptance)
- Peer rules: .cccc/rules/PEERA.md, .cccc/rules/PEERB.md
- Evidence/work roots: docs/evidence/**, .cccc/work/**

Routing defaults & backlog
- Route architecture/alignment/risks to PeerA; implementation/experiments to PeerB.
- If many pending inbox items exist, remind to process oldest‑first, then propose one smallest next step aligned to POR/SUBPOR.

Boundaries
- Do not paste long logs in messages; reference repo paths only.
- Do not modify orchestrator code/policies; do not declare 'done'.

**Planning message steps**

I think the message needs a brief assessment and some concrete next steps aligned with POR/SUBPOR. If there are a lot of pending inbox items, I should remind to tackle them oldest-first and suggest the smallest next step that fits. I’ll write to `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md` specifically. Since I have full network access, I need to remember to use shell commands to read the necessary files and put together the message. Let's begin by listing the repository structure.
codex
I’m going to quickly scan the project brief, portfolio board, active task SUBPORs, peer rules, and recent evidence/work roots, then draft a concise directive to both peers with prioritized next steps and checkpoints, saving it to the mailbox file.

**Inspecting directories**

I have the directories at hand and now I need to look closely at the `.cccc` subfolders, which include rules, mailbox, and work. I think it would be useful to create a listing of the `.cccc` tree to understand its structure better. This will help me see what’s inside and ensure that I'm not missing anything important. Let’s get this done step by step!

# POR - Strategic Board

- **North Star**: Build a 5k–10k high-signal X influencer index across **12 vertical domains** (AI/Tech, Creator, Business, Finance, Science, Design, Media, Gaming, Policy, Web3, Lifestyle, Other) with sustainable refresh & provenance, serving downstream prioritization (xoperator) and ecosystem intelligence.
- **Guardrails**: Quality (activity×relevance×safety) > quantity; no paid X API; no browser automation; all sources auditable; licensed CC BY 4.0; 100% RUBE MCP tooling.
- **Non-Goals / Boundaries**: No "encyclopedia-scale" (>15k); no NSFW/political/controversy by default; no private data; no ToS violations; no black-box scoring.

## Deliverables (top-level)
- **D1: Schema & Validation** - `schema/bigv.schema.json` + validation scripts - Both
- **D2: Collection Pipeline** - `tools/influx-{radar,harvest,expand,score,export}` CLI suite - PeerA (with Aux)
- **D3: Initial Dataset** - `data/latest/latest.jsonl.gz` (400–600 authors, M0) - Both
- **D4: Governance & Docs** - `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `docs/schema.md`, heuristics YAMLs - PeerB

## Bets & Assumptions
- **Bet 1 (FALSIFIED permanently)**: 80–90% authors discoverable via GitHub org seeds (twitter_username field) + following-graph expansion (TWITTER_FOLLOWING_BY_USER_ID, 1–2 pages per seed) | **Finding**: GitHub-seed automation path is **STRUCTURALLY INFEASIBLE** - RUBE MCP GitHub OAuth integration does not offer `read:org` scope option required for GITHUB_LIST_ORGANIZATION_MEMBERS (User #000077 verification + PeerB technical confirmation); Twitter v2 following-graph has low standalone value without GitHub seed layer | **Evidence**: T000003 investigation complete (`.cccc/work/validation/github_scope_infeasibility.md`); GitHub OAuth achieved PARTIAL SUCCESS (connection active, `['user']` scope only, cannot access org members) | **Pivot**: M1 commits to Fallback Path A (manual CSV + X Lists, proven M0 method scaled to 1.5k-2k authors, +2 week timeline vs automation) | **Original success criteria** (DEFERRED indefinitely): twitter_username coverage≥65%, mapping precision≥95%, active handles≥70%, follower Gini≥0.6, org affiliation≥30%, duplicate≤5% | Window: Automation paths unavailable within RUBE MCP free tier constraints
- **Bet 2**: Brand/official heuristics (name/bio keywords + domain patterns) filter ≥80% noise with <10% false positive | Probe: Manual review of 50 random filtered-out + 50 kept | Evidence: Precision ≥90%, Recall ≥80% | Window: M0 week 1
- **Bet 3**: Score (activity 30% + quality 50% + relevance 20%) correlates with downstream value | Probe: xoperator A/B test top-500 vs random-500 from pool | Evidence: Top-500 yield ≥2× actionable tweets | Window: M1

**Analyzing project status**

I see there's a truncation issue, but we have enough information to know that status M0.1 has been achieved with 151 authors. However, it looks like accessing the GitHub seed is blocked, so I'll consider a fallback manual path. The next steps will likely involve the M1 pipeline and D2. I also need to read the SUBPOR files to identify task owners and what the next actions should be. Let's open those files!

# T000001 - D1 — Schema validation + CI (M0) - Owner: peerB - Stage: proposed - Timebox: 0.5d

- Goal/Scope (<=3 lines):
  - Implement schema validation tool (tools/influx-validate) that validates JSONL records against schema/bigv.schema.json using jsonschema library
  - Fix schema to make `meta` required with critical sub-fields (`meta.score`, `meta.sources[>=1]`, `meta.last_refresh_at`, `provenance_hash`)
  - Create CI workflow (ci/validate.yml) that runs validator on data/latest/latest.jsonl.gz and fails PR if invalid
- Non-Goals (<=2 lines):
  - Collection tools (D2) - defer to next SUBPOR
  - Extensive schema documentation polish (already over-engineered per strategic review; focus on working validator)
- Deliverable & Interface (path/format/user-visible change):
  - tools/influx-validate: CLI tool (argparse) that validates JSONL against schema; exits 0 if valid, 1 if invalid with error details
  - schema/bigv.schema.json: Fixed schema with required `meta.score`, `meta.sources`, `meta.last_refresh_at`, `provenance_hash`
  - ci/validate.yml: GitHub Actions workflow that runs influx-validate on PRs
- Acceptance (3-5 observable items):
  [x] schema/bigv.schema.json validates correctly with jsonschema; `meta` and critical sub-fields are required
  [x] tools/influx-validate exists, runs jsonschema validation on JSONL input, checks manifest.json schema_version match

thinking
**Checking status on revisions**

I've noted that the owner shows the peerB stage as proposed, yet it's marked as completed in REV. The acceptance checkboxes indicate everything's done. However, the next step mentions needing to "fix schema ... require meta ..." even though REV shows it as completed. This could mean the generation is outdated. I think it’s smart to check other SUBPORs to compare for clarity.

# T000004 - M1 Manual Scale (151→1.5k-2k authors, 4-5 weeks) - Owner: peerB - Stage: proposed - Timebox: 4-5wk

- Goal/Scope (<=3 lines):
  - Scale influencer index from 151 (M0.1 baseline) to 1.5k-2k authors over 4-5 weeks via manual CSV curation + curated X Lists, maintaining M0's 100% precision bar and schema compliance
  - Target weekly increments of ~250-300 authors across 5-6 bootstrap domains (AI/Tech, Creator, Business, Finance, Science, Design) per Domain Coverage Plan (POR.md:55-79)
  - Method: manual CSV extraction from GitHub org pages, curated X Lists, domain-specific expert seeds → batch TWITTER_USER_LOOKUP validation → filter enforcement (entry thresholds + brand/risk heuristics) → proxy scoring → daily snapshot export
- Non-Goals (<=2 lines):
  - API automation workflows (GitHub seed expansion, Twitter following-graph) - blocked by T000003 OAuth limitations; deferred to M2
  - Advanced scoring models beyond proxy v0 (follower-based formula: 20*log10(followers/1000) + verified_boost) - defer to M2 adaptive features
- Deliverable & Interface (path/format/user-visible change):
  - data/latest/latest.jsonl.gz: Final M1 dataset with manifest.count ∈ [1500,2000], SHA-256 verified, 100% schema-compliant
  - data/snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD/: Daily snapshots via .github/workflows/snapshot.yml (cron 02:00 UTC)
  - lists/seeds/m04-*.csv through m08-*.csv: Weekly batch seed files (~250-300 handles each with source_url provenance)
  - .cccc/work/m1/: Incremental batch artifacts (harvest.filtered.jsonl, velocity logs, QA samples per batch)
- Acceptance (3-5 observable items):
  [ ] Weekly batch releases (≥250 authors/week for weeks 1-4, ≥150/week for week 5 buffer) with cumulative CI green status
  [ ] Final M1 deliverable: data/latest/latest.jsonl.gz with manifest.count ∈ [1500,2000], SHA-256 verified, score distribution reasonable (proxy v0: mean 40-60, range 0-100)
  [ ] Zero brand/official contamination in spot-check samples (N=30 per batch via manual review using .cccc/work/review/brand_fp.sample.csv methodology)

**Checking mailbox statuses**

I need to check the statuses of the mailboxes to see if there are any pending inbox items. Specifically, I have to look at the peerA and peerB mailboxes in `.cccc/mailbox/`. The Foreman writes messages to `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md`, so it’s important to also check the subfolders for messages. It feels like a lot, but I’m confident it’ll help keep everything organized!

**Evaluating inbox items**

I see there's a need to check for pending items in the inbox. I’ll look into the directories `.cccc/mailbox/peerA/inbox` and `peerB/inbox`. My first step will be to list the counts of items in both locations. It should help us determine if there's a backlog. I'll make sure to take note of any significant discrepancies between the two. It's essential to manage our communications effectively!
exec
bash -lc "ls -la .cccc/mailbox/peerA/inbox | wc -l; ls -la .cccc/mailbox/peerB/inbox | wc -l; echo 'peerA inbox files:'; ls -la .cccc/mailbox/peerA/inbox | sed -n '1,200p'; echo 'peerB inbox files:'; ls -la .cccc/mailbox/peerB/inbox | sed -n '1,200p'" in /home/dodd/dev/influx succeeded in 17ms:

thinking
**Considering routing messages**

I've noticed the inbox directories are empty, so the idea of "many pending inbox items" isn't accurate. I need to send a message to `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md`, deciding on the appropriate routing. It looks like I can include both architecture/alignment tasks to PeerA and implementation tasks to PeerB. Although the Foreman rules don't specify a structure, I think I'll follow the peer rules that's beneficial for clarity. I'll wrap the message in the required <TO_PEER> tags.
thinking
**Reviewing the Foreman rules**

Though the Foreman rules don’t specify a skeleton, I think it’s fine to include one for clarity. It’s crucial not to paste long logs, and I’ll reference file paths as evidence. For example, T000004 requires the creation of a specific directory structure and updating its stage to 'active'. T000001 appears completed, so I’ll note that, while T000002 is also done. T000003 is closed as infeasible, and we’ll need to check the pending ticket in `.cccc/work/validation/twitter_v2_ticket.txt`.
exec
bash -lc "sed -n '1,120p' .cccc/work/validation/twitter_v2_ticket.txt; echo '---'; sed -n '1,120p' .cccc/work/validation/github_scope_infeasibility.md" in /home/dodd/dev/influx succeeded in 12ms:
Subject: Enable Twitter API v2 Access for Connected App (ca_osBqL0e0ZLgZ)

Support Portal: Composio Developer Dashboard / Twitter Developer Portal
Priority: HIGH (M1 blocker)
Connection ID: ca_osBqL0e0ZLgZ
Toolkit: twitter
User: KaireiY9921 (ID: 1950833677333942272)

## Issue Description

Our Twitter connection (ca_osBqL0e0ZLgZ) is ACTIVE and authentication succeeds, but API calls to v2 endpoints return "client-not-enrolled" error. This blocks our automated influencer data collection pipeline.

## Error Details

**Endpoint**: `TWITTER_FOLLOWING_BY_USER_ID` (GET /2/users/:id/following)
**Error**: `client-not-enrolled`
**Connection Status**: ACTIVE (created 2025-10-12, last updated 2025-11-13)


thinking
**Exploring project tasks**

Alright, so I've noticed that Twitter v2 ticket text is available, which is useful for reference. I also think checking the PROJECT.md file for a summary and constraints could be helpful, though I don't need to read it all. It's mostly for alignment purposes since I already have enough information. I want to propose actions for both peers: PeerA should align and maintain POR, while PeerB moves forward with T000004 for "M1 Week1 Batch Preparation." Lastly, I need to check if a daily snapshot GitHub Action exists.

codex
I reviewed POR + SUBPORs and posted a concise Foreman directive to both peers with immediate M1 Week1 next steps and alignment asks.

- Wrote: .cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md
- Highlights:
  - PeerA: Confirm POR Roadmap reflects pivot to M1 manual path and link T000004; add Week1 alignment note.
  - PeerB: Promote T000004 to active; create .cccc/work/m1/week1/ and scaffold lists/seeds/m05-ai-tech-batch.csv (≥25 handles with source_url); record paths in SUBPOR.
- Evidence refs: docs/por/T000003-auth-unblock/SUBPOR.md, docs/por/T000004-m1-manual-scale/SUBPOR.md, .cccc/work/m1/batch05/velocity.log, data/latest/manifest.json.

Want me to also scaffold the Week1 directory and seed CSV now?
