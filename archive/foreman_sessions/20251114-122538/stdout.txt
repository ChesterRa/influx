Okay, I will begin by reviewing the project documentation to understand the goals, current status, and next steps.

Project `influx` is back on track after a critical quality crisis. The immediate plan is for PeerB to continue scaling the author list towards the 1.5k-2k M1 goal, while PeerA focuses on designing the M2 scoring model, which has been accelerated by the discovery of free API access to necessary metrics. I will now check the active tasks for each peer to get a more granular view of their work.

Okay, I have reviewed the active tasks.

*   **T000003 (Auth-unblock)** is closed. The investigation concluded that automated author discovery via GitHub is not feasible with the current tools, solidifying the project's pivot to a manual curation strategy for M1.
*   **T000004 (M1 Manual Scale)** is the active task for PeerB. The goal is to scale the author list to 1.5k-2k. The latest update shows significant progress, with the dataset now at 473 authors.

It's clear that PeerB is focused on execution and scaling the dataset, while PeerA's recent work has been on strategic planning for M2.

I will now formulate my first directive to the peers.

I will now write my first directive to the peers, acknowledging their recent success, and assigning clear, parallel tasks to maintain momentum. PeerB will continue with M1 data scaling, and PeerA will begin formalizing the M2 implementation plan.

<TO_USER>
My first directive has been sent. I've assigned PeerB to continue data scaling and PeerA to begin M2 implementation planning. I will now monitor their progress and await their updates before determining the next steps.
