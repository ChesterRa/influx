Wrote a routed directive to both peers with concrete next steps, acceptance, and refs.

- Message: .cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md:1
- Covered: POR updates (mark M0.1 achieved, add Auth-unblock as blocking), new SUBPOR draft for auth plan, snapshot export implementation and first snapshot, command refs, evidence paths.
- Owners: Architecture/risks → PeerA; Implementation/experiments → PeerB.
- Requested ack: PeerA (POR+SUBPOR submit time), PeerB (snapshot submit time).

Want me to implement the minimal tools/influx-export snapshot subcommand next?
