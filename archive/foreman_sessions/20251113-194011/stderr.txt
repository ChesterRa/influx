# FOREMAN Rules (Generated)
Generated on 2025-11-13 11:09:36 JST (UTC+09:00)

Identity
- You act as the user's proxy. Speak in the user's voice.
- Each run is non‑interactive and time‑boxed. Do one useful thing or write one short directive.

Timer & Non‑overlap
- The orchestrator runs you on a fixed interval and never overlaps runs.
- Keep long work in files; keep messages short.

Write‑to Path (single hand‑off)
- Write exactly one message per run to: `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md`.
- Put one routing header at the top:
  To: Both|PeerA|PeerB  (default Both)
- Wrap the body with `<TO_PEER> ... </TO_PEER>`.

Anchors to read (skim then decide)
- Project brief: PROJECT.md
- Portfolio board: docs/por/POR.md (Now/Next/Risks)
- Active tasks: docs/por/T*/SUBPOR.md (Owner/Next/Acceptance)
- Peer rules: .cccc/rules/PEERA.md, .cccc/rules/PEERB.md
- Evidence/work roots: docs/evidence/**, .cccc/work/**

Routing defaults & backlog
- Route architecture/alignment/risks to PeerA; implementation/experiments to PeerB.
- If many pending inbox items exist, remind to process oldest‑first, then propose one smallest next step aligned to POR/SUBPOR.

Boundaries
- Do not paste long logs in messages; reference repo paths only.
- Do not modify orchestrator code/policies; do not declare 'done'.

thinking
**Planning inbox processing**

I'm thinking about reminders for managing pending inbox items. It's important to process them oldest-first and propose the smallest next step aligned with POR/SUBPOR guidelines. I need to remember not to paste long logs or modify orchestrator code. The goal is to create or update the `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md` file with a message for peers, referencing POR and SUBPOR tasks. I'll read the necessary anchors before crafting the directive, using shell commands for file operations. Finally, I’ll provide a brief preamble to the user before executing the commands.
thinking
**Creating a task plan**

I think it would be useful to use the update_plan tool to establish clear steps, like skimming project anchors, deciding routing, crafting a directive, and writing to the mailbox. I'll keep the steps concise, maybe around four to six items. 

My plan will involve: 

1. Skimming project anchors
2. Identifying active tasks, risks, and next steps
3. Drafting a routed directive for peers
4. Writing a message to the mailbox

For the first step, I’ll mark it as in progress and run shell commands with `rg` to check file structures, focusing on specific paths mentioned in the anchors. I’ll make sure to read files in manageable chunks.
thinking
**Checking file structure and reading files**

I’m thinking of running `ls -la` to check the directory structure but it might not be necessary. Instead, I’ll focus on reading the anchored files directly. Here’s my plan:

- Use shell commands to read `PROJECT.md`.
- Access `docs/por/POR.md`.
- List directories under `docs/por/` to locate the T* directories with either `ls docs/por` or `rg -n --files docs/por/T*/SUBPOR.md`.
- Read the `SUBPOR` files.
- Check for `.cccc/rules/PEERA.md` and `PEERB.md`.
- Verify the mailbox path `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/`, creating directories as needed. I’ll prefer using `apply_patch` for file edits, which aligns with developer guidelines. Let’s get started!
codex
I’ll skim the project anchors (PROJECT.md, POR/SUBPOR, peer rules) to tailor a routed directive, then write a concise message to the mailbox file.

# POR - Strategic Board

- **North Star**: Build a 5k–10k high-signal X influencer index across **12 vertical domains** (AI/Tech, Creator, Business, Finance, Science, Design, Media, Gaming, Policy, Web3, Lifestyle, Other) with sustainable refresh & provenance, serving downstream prioritization (xoperator) and ecosystem intelligence.
- **Guardrails**: Quality (activity×relevance×safety) > quantity; no paid X API; no browser automation; all sources auditable; licensed CC BY 4.0; 100% RUBE MCP tooling.
- **Non-Goals / Boundaries**: No "encyclopedia-scale" (>15k); no NSFW/political/controversy by default; no private data; no ToS violations; no black-box scoring.

## Deliverables (top-level)
- **D1: Schema & Validation** - `schema/bigv.schema.json` + validation scripts - Both
- **D2: Collection Pipeline** - `tools/influx-{radar,harvest,expand,score,export}` CLI suite - PeerA (with Aux)
- **D3: Initial Dataset** - `data/latest/latest.jsonl.gz` (400–600 authors, M0) - Both
- **D4: Governance & Docs** - `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `docs/schema.md`, heuristics YAMLs - PeerB

## Bets & Assumptions
- **Bet 1 (FALSIFIED permanently)**: 80–90% authors discoverable via GitHub org seeds (twitter_username field) + following-graph expansion (TWITTER_FOLLOWING_BY_USER_ID, 1–2 pages per seed) | **Finding**: GitHub-seed automation path is **STRUCTURALLY INFEASIBLE** - RUBE MCP GitHub OAuth integration does not offer `read:org` scope option required for GITHUB_LIST_ORGANIZATION_MEMBERS (User #000077 verification + PeerB technical confirmation); Twitter v2 following-graph has low standalone value without GitHub seed layer | **Evidence**: T000003 investigation complete (`.cccc/work/validation/github_scope_infeasibility.md`); GitHub OAuth achieved PARTIAL SUCCESS (connection active, `['user']` scope only, cannot access org members) | **Pivot**: M1 commits to Fallback Path A (manual CSV + X Lists, proven M0 method scaled to 1.5k-2k authors, +2 week timeline vs automation) | **Original success criteria** (DEFERRED indefinitely): twitter_username coverage≥65%, mapping precision≥95%, active handles≥70%, follower Gini≥0.6, org affiliation≥30%, duplicate≤5% | Window: Automation paths unavailable within RUBE MCP free tier constraints
- **Bet 2**: Brand/official heuristics (name/bio keywords + domain patterns) filter ≥80% noise with <10% false positive | Probe: Manual review of 50 random filtered-out + 50 kept | Evidence: Precision ≥90%, Recall ≥80% | Window: M0 week 1
- **Bet 3**: Score (activity 30% + quality 50% + relevance 20%) correlates with downstream value | Probe: xoperator A/B test top-500 vs random-500 from pool | Evidence: Top-500 yield ≥2× actionable tweets | Window: M1

thinking
**Correcting glob quoting**

I realized I used the wrong glob quoting. To fix this, I'll use the bash glob format: `ls -d docs/por/T*/SUBPOR.md`, or I could try `rg -n --no-heading '^#|^Owner|^Next|^Acceptance' docs/por/T*/SUBPOR.md`. So, my next step is to try running the `ls` command to see if it works as intended. It's all about getting the right syntax to get the results I need!

# T000001 - D1 — Schema validation + CI (M0) - Owner: peerB - Stage: proposed - Timebox: 0.5d

- Goal/Scope (<=3 lines):
  - Implement schema validation tool (tools/influx-validate) that validates JSONL records against schema/bigv.schema.json using jsonschema library
  - Fix schema to make `meta` required with critical sub-fields (`meta.score`, `meta.sources[>=1]`, `meta.last_refresh_at`, `provenance_hash`)
  - Create CI workflow (ci/validate.yml) that runs validator on data/latest/latest.jsonl.gz and fails PR if invalid
- Non-Goals (<=2 lines):
  - Collection tools (D2) - defer to next SUBPOR
  - Extensive schema documentation polish (already over-engineered per strategic review; focus on working validator)
- Deliverable & Interface (path/format/user-visible change):
  - tools/influx-validate: CLI tool (argparse) that validates JSONL against schema; exits 0 if valid, 1 if invalid with error details
  - schema/bigv.schema.json: Fixed schema with required `meta.score`, `meta.sources`, `meta.last_refresh_at`, `provenance_hash`
  - ci/validate.yml: GitHub Actions workflow that runs influx-validate on PRs
- Acceptance (3-5 observable items):
  [x] schema/bigv.schema.json validates correctly with jsonschema; `meta` and critical sub-fields are required
  [x] tools/influx-validate exists, runs jsonschema validation on JSONL input, checks manifest.json schema_version match
  [x] tools/influx-validate exits 0 on valid fixture (3 hardcoded JSON objects in test/fixtures/valid.jsonl), exits 1 on invalid fixture (test/fixtures/invalid.jsonl) with clear error message
  [x] ci/validate.yml workflow exists and runs influx-validate; simulate PR validation with manual smoke test

# T000004 - M1 Manual Scale (151→1.5k-2k authors, 4-5 weeks) - Owner: peerB - Stage: active - Timebox: 4-5wk

- Goal/Scope (<=3 lines):
  - Scale influencer index from 151 (M0.1 baseline) to 1.5k-2k authors over 4-5 weeks via manual CSV curation + curated X Lists, maintaining M0's 100% precision bar and schema compliance
  - Target weekly increments of ~250-300 authors across 5-6 bootstrap domains (AI/Tech, Creator, Business, Finance, Science, Design) per Domain Coverage Plan (POR.md:55-79)
  - Method: manual CSV extraction from GitHub org pages, curated X Lists, domain-specific expert seeds → batch TWITTER_USER_LOOKUP validation → filter enforcement (entry thresholds + brand/risk heuristics) → proxy scoring → daily snapshot export
- Non-Goals (<=2 lines):
  - API automation workflows (GitHub seed expansion, Twitter following-graph) - blocked by T000003 OAuth limitations; deferred to M2
  - Advanced scoring models beyond proxy v0 (follower-based formula: 20*log10(followers/1000) + verified_boost) - defer to M2 adaptive features
- Deliverable & Interface (path/format/user-visible change):
  - data/latest/latest.jsonl.gz: Final M1 dataset with manifest.count ∈ [1500,2000], SHA-256 verified, 100% schema-compliant
  - data/snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD/: Daily snapshots via .github/workflows/snapshot.yml (cron 02:00 UTC)
  - lists/seeds/m04-*.csv through m08-*.csv: Weekly batch seed files (~250-300 handles each with source_url provenance)
  - .cccc/work/m1/: Incremental batch artifacts (harvest.filtered.jsonl, velocity logs, QA samples per batch)
- Acceptance (3-5 observable items):
  [ ] Weekly batch releases (≥250 authors/week for weeks 1-4, ≥150/week for week 5 buffer) with cumulative CI green status
  [ ] Final M1 deliverable: data/latest/latest.jsonl.gz with manifest.count ∈ [1500,2000], SHA-256 verified, score distribution reasonable (proxy v0: mean 40-60, range 0-100)
  [ ] Zero brand/official contamination in spot-check samples (N=30 per batch via manual review using .cccc/work/review/brand_fp.sample.csv methodology)

**Clarifying Week 1 directives**

In the SUBPOR T000004 REV, I've noted that Week 1 has a Pause Gate, and the preparation is complete. The next step is to execute the Week 1 batch, which involves fetching 25 users and running the pipeline to generate artifacts, but acceptance is still pending. I need to nudge PeerB to execute this batch with a manual-prefetch fallback due to a Twitter API block, ensuring all necessary outputs and validations are handled correctly.
thinking
**Coordinating evidence and updates**

I need to provide an evidence requirement in the next message. First, I should nudge PeerA to stay aligned on POR updates and manage risks. This includes documenting the pivot in the POR, monitoring quality thresholds, and confirming acceptance thresholds while ensuring we adhere to the daily snapshot schedule and QA process. 

For PeerB, I might ask them to update the acceptance checkboxes in T000004 with references. It's also essential to clarify about filing the Twitter v2 support ticket, as T000003 has some contradictions regarding this.
thinking
**Deciding on ticket filing and email organization**

As Foreman, I see that since the ticket is deferred to M2, I can ask PeerA to confirm if we should file it now to reduce lead time. However, it’s worth noting that it isn’t critical for M1. 

Now, regarding the pending inbox items, I need to check the mailbox directories for PeerA and PeerB. The rule is to remind them to process the oldest messages first if there are many pending items, so I should list out what’s in those mailboxes.

**Updating mailbox content**

The mailbox file has a sentinel indicating it was sent and overwritten. According to the rule, after sending, we replace the message file with a new one, so I need to add the full message with the header. Using apply_patch to update the file content is necessary. Given that the patch update expects specific lines, I can replace the sentinel with our new content. I'll craft a patch to ensure everything aligns just right.

**Updating plan status**

I’m considering how to update my plan now that both the drafting directive and the mailbox writing are done. It feels great to cross those off the list! So, I'll mark them as completed and adjust the overall plan status to reflect that everything is done. I wonder if there's anything more I should add or adjust while I’m at it. Let’s make sure everything is accurately completed!
Plan update
  ✓ Skim project anchors
  ✓ Identify Now/Next/Risks
  ✓ Draft routed directive
  ✓ Write mailbox message
