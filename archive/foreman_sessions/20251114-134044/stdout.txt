Okay, time to get familiar with the project. I'll start with `PROJECT.md` to understand the goals.
This is a data project indexing influential Twitter authors, aiming for a curated list of 5,000-10,000, excluding official/brand accounts. A recent data quality incident, caused by bypassing the `influx-harvest` tool, has been resolved. Now in phase M1, with a 1,500-2,000 author target, I'm processing batches m12, m13, and m11. Next, I'll review `FOREMAN_TASK.md` for my specific duties.
My job is to ensure the PEERs execute this project efficiently and to a high standard. The `PROJECT.md` shows a clear plan and that a major quality hurdle has been cleared. Next steps are defined. I'll now review `docs/por/POR.md` to understand current priorities.
This `POR.md` is a goldmine. We've surpassed the 400-author goal and are now scaling to 1.5k-2k. The pivot to manual curation, forced by RUBE MCP limitations, is working. Quality is our north star, enforced by the `influx-harvest` pipeline. PeerA handles architecture, PeerB implementation. PeerB's active task is T000004, M1 scaling. I'll check the `SUBPOR.md` for T000004 to see their progress.
PeerB is making great strides on T000004, with detailed `REV` logs showing the dataset growing to 485 authors after processing multiple batches and enforcing quality gates. I'll verify the current author count by checking `data/latest/manifest.json`.
`manifest.json` shows 494 authors, surpassing the `SUBPOR.md` count, thanks to PeerB's processing of the `m03_additional` batch. The project is progressing rapidly with effective quality control. I'll send a message to both peers via `.cccc/mailbox/foreman/to_peer.md`, acknowledging their excellent work, confirming the current status, and inquiring about their next steps to maintain momentum toward our 1.5k-2k goal.
I've messaged the peers with next steps, fulfilling my supervisory role. I've reviewed the project, confirmed progress, and given direction. Now I'll re-check the T000004 `SUBPOR.md` for updates from PeerB to stay current and provide timely feedback.
I've reviewed the `SUBPOR.md` again; no new information. My message to the peers is sent. I'll wait for their response. My turn is complete.
