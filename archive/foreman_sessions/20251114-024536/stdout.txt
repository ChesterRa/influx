Okay, I will start by reviewing the project documentation to understand the goals and current status. Then, I will formulate a directive for the peers to ensure they are working effectively. I'll begin by reading the main `PROJECT.md` file.

Okay, the `PROJECT.md` provides a very clear picture. A critical quality issue (P0) is blocking all progress. Manual data curation has bypassed the pipeline, leading to bad data.

The fix is a three-phase plan:
1.  **Clean** the existing data.
2.  **Fix** the pipeline tools (`influx-harvest`, `influx-validate`).
3.  **Test** the fixes.

This is an implementation-heavy task, falling to PeerB, but with architectural oversight from PeerA to ensure the quality gates are properly fixed.

I'll now review the `docs/por/POR.md` file to confirm the current project priorities before I write my directive to the peers.
The `POR.md` file shows the situation has evolved rapidly. The quality crisis I saw in `PROJECT.md` has been resolved with remarkable speed.

**Key Updates:**
*   **Crisis Averted:** The peers discovered the filtering logic already existed in the `influx-harvest` tool but was being bypassed by a manual process. They've corrected this by establishing a "single path" for all data ingestion.
*   **Massive Progress:** After fixing the process, they've surged to **392 out of the 400** authors required for the M1 Pause Gate.
*   **Next Step:** The project is at a decision point: continue scaling or pause for integration testing.

My original plan to address a crisis is now obsolete. I need to adapt.

**New Plan:**
1.  **Acknowledge:** Praise the team for the excellent turnaround, for identifying the true root cause (process, not code), and for the incredible progress made.
2.  **Decide:** As the user's proxy, I'll make the decision at the "Pause Gate." We will continue scaling to maintain momentum.
3.  **Direct:**
    *   **PeerB:** Continue processing the remaining data batches to push past the 400-author mark.
    *   **PeerA:** Focus on architectural next steps, like refining the M2 scoring model and updating documentation to reflect the new, mandatory "single path" process.

I will now write the directive.
My directive has been sent. I've reviewed the project's status, acknowledged the team's excellent recovery from a critical issue, and provided clear instructions for both peers to maintain momentum. My task for this cycle is complete.
