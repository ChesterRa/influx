Okay, I'll start by reviewing `PROJECT.md` and `docs/por/POR.md` to get familiar with the project.
<TO_PEER>
Okay, I have reviewed the project documentation.

**Project:** `influx` - An index of influential X/Twitter authors.
**Goal:** Build a high-quality, sustainable index of 5k-10k authors across various domains.
**Current Status:**
- The project recently recovered from a major quality crisis where unfiltered, low-quality data entered the main dataset.
- The root cause was a process failure: manual data curation bypassed the existing, functional filtering pipeline (`influx-harvest`).
- A "single-path" policy is now in effect: all data must go through the `influx-harvest` tool.
- The dataset has been cleaned, and the project has successfully reached its initial "pause gate" of 400 authors with high quality.
- The current directive is to continue scaling towards the 1.5k-2k M1 target.

**My Role:**
As Foreman, my responsibility is to oversee the progress of both Peer A (strategy, architecture) and Peer B (implementation, execution), ensuring they work efficiently and maintain the high-quality standards established after the recent crisis.

**Next Step:**
I will now check the active tasks in the `docs/por/T*/SUBPOR.md` files to understand the immediate priorities for Peer A and Peer B.
</TO_PEER>
Okay, reading `SUBPOR.md` files now to get task status. Starting with the most recent, `T000004-m1-manual-scale/SUBPOR.md`, as it's probably active.
<TO_PEER>
This is Foreman. I have reviewed the active task `T000004`.

**Task:** T000004 - M1 Manual Scale
**Owner:** PeerB
**Status:** Active
**Goal:** Scale the author index from the current count to 1.5k-2k authors.
**History:**
- The project recently passed a critical "Pause Gate" at ~400 authors.
- A major quality crisis was resolved by enforcing a "single-path" data pipeline through the `influx-harvest` tool, which has complete filtering and validation logic.
- Foreman (via user directive) has approved to **continue scaling** toward the M1 goal of 1.5k-2k authors, rather than pausing.

**Current State & Next Steps for Peers:**
- **PeerB (Execution):** Your task is to continue processing the remaining seed batches (`m11`, `m14`, etc.) using the now-proven `influx-harvest` pipeline. The immediate goal is to push the author count well past the 400 mark and continue the momentum.
- **PeerA (Strategy):** Your focus should now shift to M2 planning. This includes refining the scoring model beyond the current proxy, updating documentation to permanently reflect the single-path pipeline, and planning for the next stage of scaling.

The project is in a very good state. The recent crisis was handled exceptionally well, and the established process is robust. Let's maintain this high standard of quality and momentum. I will continue to monitor progress against the M1 goal.
</TO_PEER>
Project status reviewed, directive sent. Work complete for this cycle. Awaiting next run.
