<TO_USER>
Okay, I will start by reviewing the project documentation to understand the goals and current status.
</TO_USER>
<TO_PEER>
CLAIM
I am familiarizing myself with the project goals and status.

COUNTER
None.

EVIDENCE
I am reading the project documentation.
</TO_PEER>
<TO_USER>
I have reviewed the project documentation. It seems there was a significant quality issue recently, but it has been resolved by enforcing a strict data ingestion pipeline. The project is now back on track and has surpassed its initial goal of 400 authors, currently at 408.

The immediate next steps are:
- **PeerB:** Continue scaling the dataset by processing the remaining batches (`m03-additional-batch.csv`, `m03-final-top-tier.csv`).
- **PeerA:** Focus on the M2 scoring model refinement plan.

I will now check the current status of the project to ensure everything is aligned with the documentation.
</TO_USER>
<TO_PEER>
CLAIM
I have reviewed the project documentation and understand the current status and next steps for both peers. I will now verify the project's current state.

COUNTER
None.

EVIDENCE
The `PROJECT.md` and `docs/por/POR.md` files show a recently resolved quality crisis and a clear plan for moving forward. The project has exceeded its initial goal of 400 authors and is now at 408.
</TO_PEER>
<TO_USER>
The data validation passed with 447 records, which is more than the 408 documented. It seems PeerB has been busy. I'll check the manifest to confirm the latest count and processed batches.
</TO_USER>
<TO_PEER>
CLAIM
The project has progressed beyond the documented 408 authors, with 447 records now passing validation.

COUNTER
None.

EVIDENCE
`tools/influx-validate` reports 447 valid records, an increase from the 408 mentioned in `docs/por/POR.md`.
</TO_PEER>
<TO_USER>
The manifest confirms 447 records, so PeerB's work on the `m03` batches is done. Now, I'll review PeerA's progress on the M2 scoring model by reading `docs/por/M2-scoring-refinement.md`.
</TO_USER>
<TO_PEER>
CLAIM
PeerB has completed processing the `m03` batches, bringing the total record count to 447. I will now review PeerA's work on the M2 scoring model.

COUNTER
None.

EVIDENCE
The `data/latest/manifest.json` file confirms the record count and the completion of the `m03` batches. The next logical step is to check on PeerA's assigned task.
</TO_PEER>
<TO_USER>
The M2 scoring plan is solid. Both peers are on track; PeerB surpassed the target, and PeerA has a clear M2 roadmap. I'll message them to acknowledge their progress, outline next steps, and stress continued collaboration and quality.
</TO_USER>
<TO_PEER>
CLAIM
Both PeerA and PeerB are on track with their assigned tasks. I will now send a message to encourage them and outline the next steps.

COUNTER
None.

EVIDENCE
- PeerB has processed the `m03` batches, bringing the total author count to 447, exceeding the initial goal.
- PeerA has created a detailed plan for the M2 scoring model, as documented in `docs/por/M2-scoring-refinement.md`.
</TO_PEER>
<TO_USER>
I've messaged the peers, my oversight task for this run is complete. Now I'll check the mailbox for any new updates or blockers.
</TO_USER>
<TO_PEER>
CLAIM
I have completed my tasks for this run, which included reviewing progress, providing feedback, and outlining next steps for the peers. I am now checking for any new messages.

COUNTER
None.

EVIDENCE

No new messages. I've sent my guidance to the peers and will check for updates next time. My work here is done for now.
</TO_USER>
<TO_PEER>
CLAIM
I have completed my supervisory duties for this run. There are no new messages from the peers.

COUNTER
