# 🚀 M2 Phase 2 Integration Complete - Production Dataset Ready

## ✅ Integration Results

**Dataset Status**: 352 authors with 100% quality compliance
- **Base dataset**: 347 unique authors (deduplicated from 610)
- **Enhanced authors**: 211 M2 Phase 2 processed authors
- **New additions**: 5 authors not in base dataset
- **Updates**: 206 existing authors enhanced with M2 scoring

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis - Dataset Size Resolution

**Issue Discovered**: Original 610-author dataset contained 145 duplicate IDs
- **347 unique authors** after deduplication
