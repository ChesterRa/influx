## Strategic Assessment

### Strengths Achieved
1. **Quality-First Methodology Proven**: 100% schema compliance, meaningful scores
2. **Cross-Domain Influence Patterns**: Identified overlapping influencers (Sam Altman, Paul Graham, etc.)
3. **Domain-Specific Success Variability**: Expected and understood patterns
4. **M2 Scoring Integration**: Full activity/quality/relevance model operational

### Key Insights
1. **Tech-Adjacent Domains Outperform**: Policy/Governance (66.7%), LegalTech (66.7%), VC Investing (77.8%)
2. **Traditional Media Lower**: Gaming (8.5%), HealthTech (22.2%) due to platform-specific limitations
3. **Influencer Overlap Analysis**: High-value individuals appear across multiple domains
4. **Quality vs Quantity Trade-off**: 42.4% success rate indicates strong quality filtering

## M1 Completion Options

### Option A: Continue Current Methodology
- **Approach**: Process additional seed lists with similar domain diversity
- **Expected Success Rate**: 35-45% based on current patterns
- **Time to Complete**: 2-3 weeks for 327 authors
- **Risk**: Diminishing returns as remaining high-quality handles become scarce

### Option B: Strategic Pivot to High-Yield Domains
- **Approach**: Focus on domains with proven high success rates (VC, Policy, LegalTech)
- **Expected Success Rate**: 60-75% based on domain performance
- **Time to Complete**: 1-2 weeks for 327 authors
- **Risk**: Potential domain saturation, need fresh handle sources

### Option C: Expand Existing High-Value Influencer Networks
- **Approach**: Leverage following-graph of top 100 existing authors
- **Expected Success Rate**: 40-60% (network effect)
- **Time to Complete**: 1-2 weeks for 327 authors
- **Risk**: API quota limitations, potential brand contamination

## Recommendation

**Primary Strategy**: Option B - Strategic Pivot to High-Yield Domains
- Focus on VC Investing, Policy/Governance, and LegalTech domains
- Supplement with Option C network expansion for diversity
- Maintain quality-first methodology with proven success patterns

**Secondary Strategy**: Prepare M2 automation for post-M1 scaling
- Document successful domain patterns for future automation
- Develop following-graph expansion capabilities

## Next Immediate Actions
1. Identify high-yield domain seed lists (VC, Policy, LegalTech)
2. Expand following-graph of top 50 existing authors
3. Continue quality-first methodology with domain-specific optimization
4. Prepare M2 automation roadmap for 5k-10k scaling phase

## Risk Mitigation
- Maintain strict quality thresholds (50k+ followers, verified preference)
- Continue brand/risk filtering to prevent contamination
- Monitor for influencer overlap and deduplication
- Preserve M2 scoring model integrity for all new additions
