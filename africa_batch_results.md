3. **Evaluate automation opportunities** for 6-12h refresh cycle

### Medium-term (Next 2 weeks)
1. **Scale to 500+ authors** with domain-focused expansion
2. **Improve geographic diversity** through better research
3. **Implement M2 scoring** with real activity metrics

## Risk Status: LOW

### Quality Assurance
- **Validation**: ✅ 100% strict compliance maintained across all batches
- **Pipeline Guard**: ✅ All quality gates functioning perfectly
- **Brand Drift**: ✅ No official/brand accounts admitted

### Operational Excellence
