- Latest data: `data/release/influx-latest.jsonl` (+ `manifest.json`), Apache-2.0 licensed.
- Key traits: individual (non-brand/official), activity and follower thresholds, evidence-attached, strict validation (handle/id unique, no placeholders/mock/“000” followers).
- Quick use: download JSONL, filter by tags/score/language as needed; no pipeline run required.
