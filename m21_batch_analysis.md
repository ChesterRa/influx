# M21 HealthTech Batch Analysis - 2025-11-23

## Batch Quality Assessment
**Total Handles**: 10  
**Valid Users Found**: 9 (eric_topol not found)  
**Above Threshold**: 2 (vijay: 15.4k, johnbrown: 351)  
**Qualified for Processing**: 0 (both below 50k minimum)

## Key Issues Identified
1. **Low Follower Counts**: Only 2 users above 1k followers, none meet 50k threshold
2. **Celebrity Mismatch**: emmawatson (24.9M followers) appears to be actress Emma Watson, not genomics researcher
3. **Wrong Domain**: Most handles appear to be personal accounts, not HealthTech influencers

## Recommendation: ABORT M21 BATCH
This seed list appears to be contaminated with incorrect handles/personal accounts rather than actual HealthTech influencers.

```insight
M21 seed list quality failure: Only 2/10 handles represent actual HealthTech professionals, and both fall below our 50k follower threshold. This suggests the seed source is unreliable or outdated.

Next: Pivot to M27 BioTech batch with verified academic/industry sources rather than generic "healthtech" lists.
