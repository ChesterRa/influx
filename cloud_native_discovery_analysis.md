### DevOps/SRE Search Results
- **Low Quality Signal**: Most results were noise (SRE referring to Mexican foreign relations)
- **One Technical Account Found**: ぐらめる | SRE/Backend (158 followers)
- **Challenge**: Generic DevOps/SRE terms create high noise ratio

## Analysis

### Positive Indicators
✅ **CNCF Ambassador Program**: Rich source of qualified technical leaders  
✅ **Clear Expertise**: Ambassadors have verifiable technical contributions  
✅ **Moderate Following**: 1.8k-19k followers (good mid-tier candidates)  

### Challenges Identified
❌ **Search Noise**: "DevOps" and "SRE" terms generate high noise  
❌ **Limited Reach**: Most ambassadors below 50k follower threshold  
❌ **Geographic Distribution**: Heavy US/Europe concentration  

## Strategic Pivot Required

### Issue: Follower Count Threshold
- **Current Dataset**: Minimum 50k followers (30k for verified)
- **CNCF Ambassadors**: Most 1k-20k range
- **Gap**: Technical experts vs. influencer threshold mismatch

### Recommendation: Shift to Technical Influencers

#### New Target: Cloud Native Technical Influencers
1. **DevOps Conference Speakers** (KubeCon, AWS re:Invent)
2. **Technical Book Authors** (SRE, DevOps, Cloud Architecture)
3. **YouTube/Twitch Technical Educators** (Programming, Cloud tutorials)
4. **Technical Bloggers** (High-traffic dev blogs)
5. **Open Source Maintainers** (Major projects with large communities)

#### Revised Search Strategy
- Focus on "DevOps influencer" rather than "DevOps engineer"
- Target technical content creators with large followings
- Search for conference keynote speakers
- Identify technical book authors

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Technical Content Creator Discovery
1. Search for "DevOps YouTuber" + "technical educator"
2. Find KubeCon keynote speakers with large followings
3. Identify technical book authors in cloud/DevOps space

### Phase 2: Community Leader Mining
1. GitHub org maintainers with large Twitter presences
2. Technical conference organizers
3. Cloud platform developer advocates

### Expected Results
- **Higher Follower Counts**: Content creators typically 50k-500k followers
- **Better Quality**: Verified technical expertise through content
- **Broader Reach**: Educational content attracts diverse audiences

## Conclusion

**Pivot from Practitioners to Influencers**: CNCF ambassadors too small for dataset threshold. Focus on technical content creators, conference speakers, and authors who have both technical credibility and large followings.

**Next Action**: Search for technical content creators and conference speakers in cloud native space.
