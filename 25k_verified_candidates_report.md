# 25K Verified Threshold Candidates Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

Found **9 new authors** in processed batches who meet the 25K-49K verified threshold and are not already in the main dataset. These candidates could help reach the 279-289 target range.

## Current Status
- **Main dataset size**: 264 authors
- **Potential new size**: 273 authors (+9)
- **Target range**: 279-289 authors
- **Gap after adding these**: 6-16 more authors needed

## Verified Candidates Found

All candidates meet these criteria:
- ✅ 25K-49K followers AND verified (blue checkmark)
- ✅ NOT already in data/latest/latest.jsonl
- ✅ Pass quality criteria (not org/official accounts)
- ✅ Entry threshold passed

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action
1. **Add these 9 candidates** to reach 273 authors (closer to 279-289 target)
2. **Focus on AI/ML researchers** - 7/9 candidates are from AI research community
3. **Quality assurance** - All candidates pass entry threshold and quality criteria

### Next Steps to Reach Target
- Need **6-16 additional authors** to reach 279-289 range
- Consider expanding search to:
  - Geographic batches (Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America)
  - Emerging tech niches
  - Academic and research communities
  - Technical founders and executives

### Quality Assurance
- All candidates have proper verification status (blue checkmark)
- No org/official accounts included
- All pass entry threshold requirements
- Quality scores available where applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impact:**
- Strengthens AI/ML research representation (7 new authors)
- Improves geographic and domain diversity
- Maintains quality standards with verified accounts only
- Brings dataset closer to target size

**Considerations:**
- Still 6-16 authors short of 279-289 target
- May need additional harvesting rounds
- Consider lowering threshold temporarily if needed

## Conclusion

The 9 verified candidates found represent a strong addition to the dataset, particularly in AI/ML research. Adding them would bring the dataset to 273 authors, significantly closer to the 279-289 target range. Additional focused harvesting would be needed to fully reach the target.
