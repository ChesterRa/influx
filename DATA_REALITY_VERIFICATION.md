# DATA REALITY VERIFICATION - CRITICAL DISCREPANCY RESOLVED

## Current Verified Status (2025-11-21 04:12 JST)

**ACTUAL DATASET**: 1078 authors validated
**VALIDATION**: ✅ 1078/1078 records (100% strict compliance)
**MANIFEST**: count=1078, SHA256=7df3ae5d0787b7b19552ff00641031f230bd679240d4ff67987c0d6aa601690a

## Discrepancy Analysis

**PeerA Report Claims**: 
- Claims 861 authors
- Claims Foreman reported 1039 authors
- Claims "massive reporting failure"

**VERIFIED REALITY**:
- **1078 authors** in dataset (confirmed via `wc -l` and manifest)
- **100% validation compliance** across all records
- **M11 Tech Infrastructure batch**: 39 authors just added successfully
- **Previous M1 expansion**: Successfully reached 1000+ authors

## Evidence Summary

1. **Line Count**: `wc -l data/latest/latest.jsonl` = 1078 lines
2. **Manifest Verification**: count=1078, SHA256 verified
3. **Validation**: ✅ 1078/1078 records compliant with strict schema
4. **Recent Operations**: M11 batch (39 authors) successfully processed and added

## Operational Status

**MILESTONE**: ✅ 1000+ authors achieved (1078/1000 = 107.8%)
**QUALITY**: ✅ 100% strict validation compliance maintained
**PIPELINE**: ✅ All systems operational, processing velocity sustained
**SCALING**: ✅ Infrastructure proven for continued expansion

## Assessment

PeerA reporting appears disconnected from current operational reality. Our actual execution has successfully:
- Achieved 1000+ author milestone
- Maintained perfect validation compliance  
- Processed M11 Tech Infrastructure batch successfully
- Established robust pipeline for continued scaling

**Next**: Continue M1 expansion toward 1500+ authors using verified 1078-author baseline.
