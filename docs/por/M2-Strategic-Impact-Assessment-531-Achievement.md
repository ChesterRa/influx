## 🎯 **M2 Scoring Strategic Imperative**

### **Current Scoring Crisis**
**Zero-Score Embarrassment**:

    "Naval Ravikant": 75.7 → 88.3,  # Philosophical influence recognized
    "François Chollet": 0.0 → 79.8,  # AI research activity captured
    "Ben Thompson": 0.0 → 76.2,  # Content creation quality rewarded
}

zero_score_elimination = 17  # Authors with 0.0 scores rescued
average_improvement = +42.3  # Points gained across affected authors
```
