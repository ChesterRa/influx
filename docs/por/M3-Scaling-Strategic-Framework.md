- **Score Distribution**: Healthy M2 scoring ranges (4.0-60.0) preserved
- **Data Freshness**: Weekly activity metrics updates for 95%+ authors

### Scaling Targets
- **Phase 1**: 2k authors (3.8x expansion) in 4-6 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 5k authors (9.4x expansion) in 8-12 weeks  
- **Phase 3**: 10k authors (18.8x expansion) in 16-24 weeks

### Operational Targets
- **Cost Model**: Maintain $0/year API integration
- **Processing Velocity**: 100+ authors/week with automated quality gates
- **Quality Assurance**: <1% error rate with automated monitoring
- **Downstream Integration**: Real-time API endpoints for xoperator consumption

## Risk Mitigation

### Quality Risks
