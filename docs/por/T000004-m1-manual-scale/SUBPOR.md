# T000004 - M1 Manual Scale (151→1.5k-2k authors, 4-5 weeks) - Owner: peerB - Stage: active - Timebox: 4-5wk

- Goal/Scope (<=3 lines):
  - Scale influencer index from 151 (M0.1 baseline) to 1.5k-2k authors over 4-5 weeks via manual CSV curation + curated X Lists, maintaining M0's 100% precision bar and schema compliance
  - Target weekly increments of ~250-300 authors. NOTE: To align the manual M1 execution with the North Star, domain coverage will be focused and measurable. M1 will establish deep coverage (≥300 authors each) in 3 core domains (AI/Tech, Business, Creator Economy) and opportunistic coverage (≥100 authors each) in 2-3 additional domains based on seed quality.
  - Method: manual CSV extraction from GitHub org pages, curated X Lists, domain-specific expert seeds → batch TWITTER_USER_LOOKUP validation → filter enforcement (entry thresholds + brand/risk heuristics) → proxy scoring → daily snapshot export
- Non-Goals (<=2 lines):
  - API automation workflows (GitHub seed expansion, Twitter following-graph) - blocked by T000003 OAuth limitations; deferred to M2
  - Advanced scoring models beyond proxy v0 (follower-based formula: 20*log10(followers/1000) + verified_boost) - defer to M2 adaptive features
- Deliverable & Interface (path/format/user-visible change):
  - data/latest/latest.jsonl.gz: Final M1 dataset with manifest.count ∈ [1500,2000], SHA-256 verified, 100% schema-compliant
  - data/snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD/: Daily snapshots via .github/workflows/snapshot.yml (cron 02:00 UTC)
  - lists/seeds/m04-*.csv through m08-*.csv: Weekly batch seed files (~250-300 handles each with source_url provenance)
  - .cccc/work/m1/: Incremental batch artifacts (harvest.filtered.jsonl, velocity logs, QA samples per batch)
- Acceptance (3-5 observable items):
  [ ] Weekly author yield of 200-350 new authors who pass all quality gates (entry threshold, brand/risk filters). Cumulative CI must remain green.
  [ ] Final M1 deliverable: data/latest/latest.jsonl.gz with manifest.count ∈ [1500,2000], SHA-256 verified, score distribution reasonable (proxy v0: mean 40-60, range 0-100)
  [ ] Domain diversity: Final M1 dataset includes ≥3 core domains with ≥300 authors each, and ≥2 additional domains with ≥100 authors each, as specified in the Goal/Scope.
  [ ] Zero brand/official contamination in spot-check samples (N=30 per batch via manual review using .cccc/work/review/brand_fp.sample.csv methodology)
  [ ] QA validation: 50-record sample per 300-author batch with second-review signoff on edge cases
  [ ] Provenance tracking: 100% of authors have sources array with method/fetched_at/evidence fields populated
- Probe (cheapest decisive): **M1 Batch 0.5 (≤2 days)**: Collect 50-100 authors manually from 1-2 domains (AI/Tech + Business), run through complete pipeline (CSV → USER_LOOKUP → filter → score → validate → export), measure actual curation velocity (records/hour), QC pass rate, and filter precision to empirically validate 250-300/week assumption before committing to full 4-5 week timeline. Evidence targets: .cccc/work/m1/batch05/harvest.filtered.jsonl (≥50 records), validation 100% pass, velocity log showing ≥15-20 records/hour sustained rate.
- Kill Criteria (when to stop/pivot): If actual curation velocity <150 records/week (vs projected 250-300/week) after batch 0.5 probe, re-scope M1 downward (target 1k-1.2k authors over 6-8 weeks with additional curator resources) or pivot to semi-automated hybrid approach if Twitter API unblocks
- Implementation Approach (<=3 bullets):
  - **Phase 1: Batch 0.5 Probe (≤2 days)**: Manually curate 50-100 high-confidence authors (AI/Tech + Business domains), measure velocity (records/hour) and QC overhead, validate filter precision on first real-world batch
  - **Phase 2: Weekly Increments (Weeks 1-4)**: Target ~250-300 authors/week using domain rotation (AI/Tech → Creator/Platform → Business/Finance → Science/Design), daily CSV→JSONL pipeline runs, filter enforcement per d2-pipeline-contract.md, QA spot-checks (N=30 sample/batch)
  - **Phase 3: Buffer Week (Week 5)**: Target ≥150 authors to reach 1.5k-2k cumulative, final QA sweep (100-record validation sample), score distribution analysis, prepare M1 release artifacts
- Evidence (minimal refs):
  - filters.implementation: commit:6fd9487 (tools/influx-harvest with brand/risk filters per d2-pipeline-contract.md:105-123)
  - snapshot.automation: commit:060d273 (.github/workflows/snapshot.yml daily cron)
  - filter.baseline: .cccc/work/review/brand_fp.sample.csv (20 boundary cases), brand_fp.validation.txt (M0 Precision=100% baseline)
  - (pending batch 0.5): .cccc/work/m1/batch05/harvest.filtered.jsonl, velocity.log, qa_sample.csv
- Risks/Dependencies (1 line each):
  - Risk: Actual curation velocity <<250/week invalidates 4-5 week timeline; Mitigation: Batch 0.5 probe measures real velocity before full commitment, allows re-scoping
  - Risk: Brand/risk filter FP rate 15-25% (per .cccc/work/review/brand_fp.validation.txt projection) degrades precision; Mitigation: QA spot-checks (N=30/batch) + heuristics tuning via observed FP patterns
  - Dependency: Twitter API TWITTER_USER_LOOKUP_BY_USERNAMES functional (currently blocked by client-not-enrolled); Mitigation: Manual CSV export as fallback (proven in M0.1 with 151 authors)
  - Dependency: Daily snapshot automation (.github/workflows/snapshot.yml) operational before batch 1; Mitigation: Manual export fallback if workflow fails
- Next (single, decidable, <=30 minutes): **Continue M1 scaling by processing weekly batches, aiming for a cumulative total of 1.5k-2k authors, while maintaining all quality gates.** Process unsaturated data batches (m12-opensource, m13-security, m14-datascience) with proven 50%+ acceptance rates from tech infrastructure domain validation.
