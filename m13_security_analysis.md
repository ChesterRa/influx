```insight
Technical domain validation: M13 confirms 75% qualified rate in security domain, but 83% are already captured. We need to go deeper into mid-tier security niches (specialized researchers, regional experts) rather than top-tier personalities.

Next: Process remaining 32 M13 handles to find mid-tier security specialists not in current dataset.
