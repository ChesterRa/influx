# X Lists for Curated Seed Collection (M0 Target: 40-80 authors)
# Format: One X List URL per line
# Quality bar: verified+30k OR 50k followers; AI/Tech/Creator/Ecosystem domains
# Source: Public X Lists with high-signal AI/ML/Tech influencers
#
# Note: Each List URL should be in format: https://x.com/i/lists/{list_id}
# or https://twitter.com/i/lists/{list_id}
#
# Instructions for influx-harvest x-lists:
# 1. Fetch List members via RUBE MCP (TWITTER_LIST_MEMBERS or equivalent)
# 2. Apply gating filters: (verified + 30k) OR 50k followers
# 3. Apply brand/official heuristics (lists/rules/brand_heuristics.yml)
# 4. Apply risk term filters (lists/rules/risk_terms.yml)
# 5. Output JSONL with sources[method="x_list", evidence="x.com/i/lists/{id}"]
#
# TODO: Replace with actual X List URLs
# Recommended categories:
# - AI Researchers (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, etc.)
# - ML Engineers (PyTorch, TensorFlow, HuggingFace community)
# - Tech Founders/Executives (AI startup ecosystem)
# - AI/ML Content Creators (educators, explainers, technical YouTubers)
# - Platform/Ecosystem leaders (developer advocates, community builders)
#
# Placeholder examples (REPLACE WITH REAL LIST URLs):
# https://x.com/i/lists/1234567890  # AI Researchers
# https://x.com/i/lists/1234567891  # ML Engineers
# https://x.com/i/lists/1234567892  # Tech Founders
# https://x.com/i/lists/1234567893  # AI Educators
# https://x.com/i/lists/1234567894  # Platform Leaders

# EMPTY FILE - NEEDS USER INPUT
# This file is intentionally empty pending user specification of X Lists to include.
# Without specific List URLs, influx-harvest x-lists will not run.
#
# Next step: User should provide 3-8 X List URLs covering AI/Tech/Creator domains
# to enable the 10% curated collection path (40-80 authors for M0).
