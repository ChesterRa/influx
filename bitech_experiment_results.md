# BioTech Mid-Tier Experiment Results - 2025-11-23

## Critical Finding: Academic Researchers Not Active on Twitter
**Total Handles**: 9  
**Valid Users**: 8 (georgechurch suspended)  
**Above 50k Threshold**: 0/8  
**Above 1k Followers**: 1/8 (drewendy: 6.7k)

### Results Analysis
- **drewendy**: 6.7k followers (Stanford bioengineering) - Below threshold
- **All others**: <20 followers each (inactive/placeholder accounts)
- **Pattern**: Academic researchers use Twitter minimally

### Strategic Implication
**Mid-tier niche hypothesis needs refinement**: Academic BioTech researchers are not Twitter-active. Need to target:
1. **BioTech Company Executives** (not academics)
2. **Science Communicators** (not researchers)
3. **Biotech Journalists** (not practitioners)

```insight
Academic blind spot: prestigious BioTech researchers maintain minimal Twitter presence. Mid-tier niche strategy must target "science communicators" and "biotech business leaders" rather than pure researchers.

Next: Pivot to ClimateTech hardware/energy storage companies - executives and founders are more likely to be Twitter-active than academics.
