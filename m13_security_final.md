```insight
Security domain completion: M13 confirms we've captured the vast majority of security influencer landscape. High-density technical domains show diminishing returns as we approach saturation.

Strategic recommendation: Pivot to emerging technical domains (AI infrastructure, DevOps tooling) where duplicate rates may be lower and qualified rates remain high.
